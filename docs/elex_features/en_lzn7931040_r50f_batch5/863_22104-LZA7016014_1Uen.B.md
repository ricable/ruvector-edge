# 3 Feature Operation of LTE Adaptive Codeword Selection for VoLTE

The feature enables using one codeword for VoLTE-only traffic for downlink

transmissions.

The LTE Adaptive Codeword Selection for VoLTE feature enables the use of one codeword for

VoLTE-only traffic. The feature is operational the on cell level.

Operational Process

The feature uses the EUtranCellFDD.oneCwSelectionForVolteEnabled

and the EUtranCellTDD.oneCwSelectionForVolteEnabled attributes to

determine whether selecting one codeword for VoLTE-only traffic is enabled.

If the value of the EUtranCellFDD.oneCwSelectionForVolteEnabled or

the EUtranCellTDD.oneCwSelectionForVolteEnabled attribute is set

to true, selecting one codeword for VoLTE-only traffic is

enabled.

If the value of the EUtranCellFDD.oneCwSelectionForVolteEnabled or

the EUtranCellTDD.oneCwSelectionForVolteEnabled attribute is set

to false, one-codeword or two-codeword downlink transmission takes

place based on the channel quality and the amount of data to be transmitted.

# 4 Network Impact of LTE Adaptive Codeword Selection for VoLTE

The feature might improve VoLTE robustness by enabling the use of one codeword for

downlink transmission for VoLTE-only traffic.

Capacity and Performance

The feature affects the capacity and performance of the network in the following

ways:

- VoLTE performance might improve.
- Downlink cell and UE throughput might decrease.
- Downlink PRB utilization might increase.
- Downlink packet loss rate might decrease.
- Downlink HARQ BLER might decrease.

If several UEs are scheduled with VoLTE-only traffic, the following changes can be

observed:

- The DL Scheduled Entities per TTI resource indicator might decrease.
- The number of PRBs might be insufficient on the node level depending on the total number of resources available for each RAN Compute unit.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not have a software

license key associated, which means that they have no entries in the LKF that is

installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured manually or have

some of their subfunctions enabled to work properly.
