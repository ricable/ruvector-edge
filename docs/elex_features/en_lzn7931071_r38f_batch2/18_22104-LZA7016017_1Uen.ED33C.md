# 1 Scheduler High-Band Overview

The feature distributes radio interface and radio node resources between various user

and control data flows that request transmission in the

cell.

Summary

The feature gives priority to robust system control signaling and retransmissions over user

data. Users can be multiplexed and scheduled efficiently in time, using spectral and

hardware resources to optimize user throughput and cell capacity. The feature

performs data transmission on the basis of predefined TDD patterns. Selective data

transmission is handled by the feature based on such transmission patterns, and

dynamic slot use.

Scheduling, also referred to as DRA, is done dynamically for every slot. For every upcoming

slot, the Scheduler High-Band feature determines which users are assigned radio

interface and radio node resources.

The feature provides resource assignment for downlink and uplink UE traffic for multiple

carriers and multiple users, depending on the activated features and hardware

capabilities.

# 3 Feature Operation of Scheduler High-Band

The Scheduler High-Band feature prioritizes and allocates resources for the radio

network based on input from the operator.

Operational Process

1. If data is available on downlink data transmission, downlink scheduling candidates are sent to the Scheduler High-Band feature.
2. Uplink scheduling candidates are sent to the Scheduler High-Band feature for every possible uplink slot with the assumption that UE has a full buffer of data.Note: The power headroom reports (PHR) of the UE are not considered during scheduling.
3. At the beginning of each slot, the Scheduler High-Band feature receives scheduling candidates and information on radio resources.
4. If resources are available and there are relevant downlink or uplink scheduling candidates, the Scheduler High-Band feature allocates an appropriate amount of resources to the UE. PRBs are allocated as scheduling elements to available slots.

## 3.1 Periodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH in High-Band

A Scheduling Request (SR) configuration consists of a set of PUCCH resources for

Scheduling Requests across different BWPs and cells. A Scheduling Request is used by the UE

to request PUSCH resources for a new PUSCH transmission.

In NR, the Scheduling Request is configured on the logical channel level, not on the UE

level as in LTE.

When the UE has pending uplink data to transmit, it triggers a pending Scheduling

Request. The UE sends its pending Scheduling Request to the gNodeB in dedicated periodic

SR PUCCH format 0 resources.

The dedicated periodic SR PUCCH resources are configured by the gNodeB through the RRC.

The UE is configured to transmit the Scheduling Request on the SR PUCCH resources up to

64 times. It is possible that the UE fails to receive a scheduling grant despite the SR

PUCCH transmissions. In such cases, the UE schedules the Scheduling Request on

RACH.

Apart from transmitting the pending Scheduling Request on the periodic SR PUCCH resource,

the UE can also multiplex Scheduling Request information. Multiplexing occurs on a

HARQ-ACK PUCCH resource, overlapping in time. In this case, the UE performs the

following events:

- Multiplexes the Scheduling Request information into the HARQ-ACK information message.
- Transmits the Scheduling Request information on the HARQ-ACK PUCCH resource.
- Avoids transmission on the SR PUCCH resource.

The periodic SR PUCCH resource is set for four

or eight slots depending

on

the

TDD pattern. The gNodeB decodes the following types of PUCCH resources

to retrieve the Scheduling Request information:

- Periodic SR
- HARQ-ACK

The periodic SR PUCCH resource has the following characteristics:

- Supported for all High-Band patterns.
- Potentially decreases the latency of devices using Connected Mode DRX (C-DRX).
- It is decoded with dedicated periodic SR PUCCH resources.
- The following specific RRC configuration parameters are provided to the UE: Periodicity Cyclic shift PRB

The periodic SR PUCCH resource can be multiplexed on aperiodic HARQ-ACK PUCCH resources.

Different devices handle the periodic SR PUCCH resource differently, depending on their

capabilities. HARQ-ACK PUCCH resources constitute either one or two slots.

Service-adaptive SR periodicity configurations can reduce

PUCCH decoding rate for non-time-critical services to prioritize PUCCH decoding on

latency-critical services.

The following counters are introduced for the measurement of the periodic SR PUCCH

resource:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSrNote: It is possible that the UE fails to access the node by the Scheduling Request over PUCCH. In such cases, the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSr counter counts the number of received Scheduling Requests over RACH. With the Improved Periodic SR function, the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSr PM counter is updated to count the number of times an SR on RACH triggers RRC reconfiguration to restore normal scheduling. To maintain observability for the number of RRC reconfigurations on RACH for each C-RNTI, the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchSrResourcesRestoredDistr PM counter is introduced.
- NRCellDU.pmMacPucchSrPuschGrantLatDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlUnresUePucchSrGrant
- NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchSrResourcesRestoredDistrNote: When the value of the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSr PM counter is abnormally high, the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchSrResourcesRestoredDistr counter can be checked to determine if this is caused by UE behavior or radio conditions.

The Periodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH function can affect the

NRCellDU.pmRadioPuschTable1McsDistr counter.

Existing

scheduling serves a significant part of uplink traffic with MCS 0 when uplink traffic is

low. This occurs when the gNodeB preschedules UEs in the following conditions:

- UEs inactive during beam management
- UEs active immediately after data transmission in the downlink or in the uplink

In such cases, the gNodeB uses MCS 0, as it is not aware if the UE has pending

uplink data to transmit. The Periodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH function allows

non-active UEs to be scheduled directly on the MCS most suitable for the UE, as the

gNodeB is aware of its pending uplink data. In cells with good radio conditions, this

results in more pegs on higher MCSs in the

NRCellDU.pmRadioPuschTable1McsDistr counter.

This function also affects the NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalMenb

counter. Physical restrictions over the air interface can prohibit the

gNodeB from serving the UE with an uplink grant within the

short latency this function introduces. These physical restrictions can manifest in

radio conditions that prevent RACH resources from reaching the gNodeB. In such cases, the gNodeB

releases the UE from SCG radio resources and pegs the

NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalMenb counter. After this, the UE can

reattach to the network with normal handling.

To minimize impact on the NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalMenb counter due

to feature activation, the settings recommended by Ericsson must be used for the above

parameters, as frequently using MCG radio resources can cause unwanted drops. For more

information, see RAN Parameter Recommendations List.

If the Coverage-Optimized Uplink Scheduling High-Band feature is active, the

Scheduling Request PUCCH resource allocation is moved to the inner region of the

bandwidth to reduce MPR.

## 3.2 Coverage-Adaptive SR Periodicity in High-Band

SR periodicity is automatically configured based on radio conditions.

The number of abnormal UE releases is increased in High-Band at the edge of cells where

radio conditions are poor. The coverage-adaptive SR periodicity for High-Band

functionality allows the gNodeB to determine if a UE is in good or limited uplink radio

coverage based on the configured RSRP threshold and uplink SINR thresholds.

At secondary gNodeB addition or PSCell change, radio conditions are determined based on

RSRP measurements and a configured initial RSRP threshold. The RSRP threshold is set

using the SrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg.covAdaptSrPStartRsrpThresh

attribute.

When the UE is in connected mode, the gNodeB continuously evaluates radio conditions

based on uplink SINR. The SINR thresholds used for estimating the channel conditions are

configured using the

SrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg.covAdaptSrPNrLowQualThresh and

SrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg.covAdaptSrPNrQualHyst attributes.

When the UE is in limited coverage, SR periodicity is configured to the maximum supported

number of slots to prolong the SR requests on PUCCH. If the UE returns to better radio

conditions, SR periodicity is set to the configured SR periodicity value.

For EN-DC and NR-DC deployments, the benefits from the functionality are seen only when

SR periodicity is changed to a longer duration while the uplink leg is active on SCG. It

is recommended to set the coverage-adaptive SR periodicity threshold value higher by at

least 3 dB than the uplink leg switch threshold.

It is recommended to set the

SrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg.covAdaptSrPEnabled attribute to false

when using NR standalone High-Band deployments.

## 3.3 Scheduling Priority

The feature determines which UEs are assigned resources in each slot of each

cell.

Scheduling is based on the scheduling weight attached to the PRBs. The user with the

longer scheduling delay is to be scheduled earlier. If

the Priority-Controlled Scheduling and NR Relative Priority Scheduling features are

activated, priority can be configured on a DRB level. As a result, the scheduling weight

is a combination of the user DRB priority and waiting time.

HARQ

In NR, HARQ has the following characteristics both in the downlink and in the

uplink:

| Asynchronous   |    | No predefined timing for retransmissions occurs.     The number of HARQ processes is explicitly indicated in                                         DCI.   |
|----------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                |    |                                                                                                                                                             |
| Adaptive       |    | HARQ retransmission requires an uplink grant or a downlink                             assignment.                                                          |

HARQ ACK is sent on PUCCH.

The HARQ procedure is also used for Msg3 PUSCH. Msg3 HARQ has the following

characteristics:

- It triggers the UE to attempt Msg3 retransmission during the ra-ContentionResolutionTimer.
- It is determined by DCI 0\_0.

## 3.4 Scheduling Channels

The feature uses different resources in the downlink and the uplink

channels.

## 3.5 Scheduling Algorithm for High-Band

Summary

If the Priority-Controlled Scheduling and NR Relative

Priority Scheduling features are activated, resource-fair scheduling is used with

DRB priority. Multiple downlink and uplink scheduling candidates are sent

to the Scheduler High-Band feature. In the downlink, scheduling candidates are based

on downlink buffer status. In the uplink, devices are scheduled either based on

PUCCH SR, BSR, or prescheduling.

The scheduling rank corresponds to the number of layers using the same TDD or FDD

resources. In High-Band, transmission ranks 1 and 2 are supported.

Link Adaptation

Link adaptation determines the amount of data that can be scheduled and the

conditions of scheduling. Such conditions include, for example, the used MCS, the

number of layers and precoding. Link adaptation occurs in each component carrier

when carrier aggregation is used.

Downlink decisions on the amount of scheduled data are based on reports from the UE.

These reports provide the gNodeB information on channel

quality and suggested scheduling rank. The gNodeB schedules

a symbol containing CSI-RS and CSI-IM for measurements in the downlink and

corresponding resources for reporting in the uplink. In addition to the reported CQI

and scheduling rank, the gNodeB also compensates for the

HARQ NACK ratio. Compensation occurs on original transmissions when selecting the

MCS.

In the uplink, decision on the number of layers, for UEs capable of

UL MIMO, is based on the following information:

- The rank reported by the UE, which is treated as an upper limitation
- Measured SINR and SINR difference between the layers

In transition to single-layer transmissions, for UEs capable of UL MIMO, the

SINR difference determines the layer to use.

Decisions on the amount of scheduled data are based on the following information:

- SINR measured on the used layer in single-layer transmissions
- The average SINR over two layers, in two-layer transmissions

All SINR measurements occur on PUSCH DMRS on each layer.

If the Coverage-Optimized Uplink Scheduling High-Band feature is active,

the number of PRBs allocated to the link adaptation CSI reports is decreased. This

ensures better reception of the link adaptation CSI reports. In addition, inner PRB

allocation is applied for PUSCH to reduce MPR. Inner PRB allocation for PUSCH takes

place when the number of scheduled PRBs is equal or less than one-third of the total

carrier bandwidth.

Scheduling Overlapping Symbols in SCells

In downlink slots, the CSI-RS and PDCCH symbols are often only transmitted on a

subset of the downlink carriers. The other carriers can instead be used to transmit

PDSCH data.

PDSCH data can only be transmitted to one UE for each slot, and the use of

overlapping symbols depends on three use cases. Since only one beam direction, at

the same time, can be applied for carriers mapped to one PAAM segment different

constraint are applied according to use cases.

The following use cases are available for this function:

- CSI-RS symbols for P2 Beam Tracking, with following constraints: Sector carriers at same PAAM segment as the cell carrying CSI-RS information cannot be used. CSI-RS and PDSCH cannot be scheduled to the same UE for this use case.
- CSI-RS symbols for Link Adaptation, with following constraints Sector carriers at same PAAM segment as the PSCell carrying CSI-RS information cannot be used, unless CSI-RS and PDSCH are scheduled to the same UE.
- PDCCH symbols for UL DCI, with following constraints Sector carriers at same PAAM segment as the Cell carrying UL DCI information cannot be used, unless PDCCH and PDSCH are scheduled to the same UE.

Uplink Component Aggregation

Uplink component aggregation allows the configuration of multiple PSCells and up to

two SCells in the uplink. To configure up to three SCells in the uplink, carrier

aggregation with four component carriers must be supported. The bandwidth-dependent

scheduling limits determine the maximum number of scheduled SCells in the

uplink.

Downlink Component Aggregation

Downlink component aggregation allows for optimal downlink throughput and carrier

use. All downlink slots can use all carriers both for new data transmission and

retransmission purposes. The same downlink scheduling priority is assigned to new

data transmissions and retransmissions. New data and retransmission data are

co-scheduled with the following characteristics:

- In the same slot
- For the same UE candidate
- On different carriers

In this way, the scheduling use of the number of used carriers can be

increased. Also, fair slot distribution can be secured among devices with pending

downlink data but different HARQ NACK or downlink transmission rates.

Downlink component aggregation is supported with the available TDD patterns.

NR RU Intelligent Temperature Handling

This function enables the radio unit to regulate the temperature pre-emptively. This

allows the operation to continue even when the ambient temperature or the load

exceeds operational limits.

If the radio unit detects that the internal temperature exceeds a threshold, it

requests the gNodeB to limit scheduling intensity

in downlink. This limit is based on the temperature in the radio unit.

The NR RU Intelligent Temperature Handling function ensures that the high-band

scheduler does not exceed the PDSCH resources provided by the radio unit. Traffic

conditions can make the PDSCH slot use exceed the set maximum. In such cases, the

gNodeB forcefully blanks, that is, delays the

scheduling of some PDSCH slots. In this way, it conforms to the set limit. The

NRCellDU.pmRadioPdschEmptySlotsForced PM counter is stepped

for each forcefully blanked slot.

The radio unit uses the blank slots to lower energy output. It utilizes the Micro

Sleep TX feature. Reduced energy consumption lowers the temperature of the radio

unit over time.

## 3.6 Beam Management

The Scheduler High-Band feature is involved in beam management for resource and

report scheduling.

There are three procedures for establishing a wide beam to track the best narrow beam.

These procedures are the following:

- Beam establishment

Figure 1   Example of Beam Refinement from Wide to Narrow Beam

Beam Establishment

The SSB beam sweeps occur on wide beams. The UE measures the SSBs and selects the

best SSB beam. This SSB beam is used to send the random access preamble on the

random access occasion that maps to the respective wide beams of the chosen SSB. The

procedure is also called beam acquisition.

The Downlink Power Boost for Initial Access High-Band can

help with connection establishment. If this feature is active, the PDCCH power of

the following messages can be boosted:

- Msg2
- Msg3 retransmission grant
- Msg4 grant
- Initial P2 refinement

The PRBs of the PDSCH are moved to the center and the coverage of Msg2 can also

be boosted.

gNodeB Beam Refinement and Advanced P2/gNodeB Tracking

After the finalization of the random access procedure, beam refinement is triggered.

CSI resources and CSI reports are scheduled, one for each narrow beam in the

selected wide beam. The gNodeB sets the CSI

request field to the aperiodic trigger state entry that corresponds to the selected

wide beam. The narrow beam CSI resources can be distributed in the following

ways:

- Split into two different resource sets scheduled in two consecutive downlink slots (12 CSI-RS symbols)
- Scheduled in one resource set of a single slot (six or seven CSI-RS symbols)

A corresponding CSI report is scheduled in the uplink, based on the selected

number of CSI resource sets and containing the following elements:

- One RSRP measurement result for each resource set in case of 12 CSI-RS symbols
- Two RSRP measurement results for the single resource set in case of six or seven CSI-RS symbols

The number of used CSI-RS symbols determine the number of CSI-RS slots for beam

tracking.

Table 3   CSI-RS Slot Configuration

| Number of CSI-RS Symbols   |   Number of Configured CSI-RS Slots |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 12                         |                                   2 |
| 6 or 7                     |                                   1 |

There can be OFDM symbols which do not overlap with CSI-RS symbols in the

slot. These symbols are used for PDSCH scheduling in Primary Cells and all available

Secondary Cells. Symbols on Secondary cells, overlapping CSI-RS symbols on Primary

cell, are also used for PDSCH scheduling when possible as described in Scheduling Algorithm for High-Band.

In the course of beam refinement, a CSI-RS resource indicator (CRI) is delivered with the best RSRP measurement result of both reports.

The CRI with the best RSRP measurement result of both reports is used subsequently

for the following purposes in the given order:

- Triggering a link adaptation measurement
- Beginning data scheduling

Narrow beam tracking is performed within the following beam configurations:

- Current wide beam
- Current wide beam including neighboring narrow beams of other wide beams
- Another wide beam

In case of CSI resource and CSI report scheduling, the best SSB is measured.

When a new best SSB is found, a CSI-RS narrow beam measurement is performed within

that SSB.

The SSB Power Boost feature can increase SSB

transmission power in High-Band. Increased SSB transmission power reduces the

received power difference between wide and narrow beams. In this way, the SSB Power Boost feature can improve gNodeB

beam refinement.

UE Beam Refinement and Tracking

The UE can perform beam refinement based on SSB and TRS. There are

three

symbols with DMRS

in

every SSB period.

During

this

time,

the UE can evaluate

three

beams. Aperiodic CSI-RS can be scheduled for the UE to perform UE beam

refinement.

## 3.7 Measurement Gap Handling for Scheduler High-Band

UEs can be configured with a measurement gap in NR-DC and NR standalone

deployments.

If the UE is configured with a measurement gap, the UE is not scheduled for downlink and

uplink transmission during the measurement gap, except for the Random Access

procedure.

In an NR-DC configuration, the measurement gap on the Master Node is only forwarded to

the Secondary Node scheduler if the

following

conditions apply:

- A measurement gap is configured for all frequencies or High-Band frequencies.
- The measurement gap configuration is changed.

For more information, see Measurement Gap-Aware NR Scheduling.

# 4 Network Impact of Scheduler High-Band

The

feature ensures efficient resource assignment for UEs and reduces equipment heating by

controlling energy output.

Coverage

The scheduling of resources is based on prevailing channel condition and buffer

status.

Scheduler Load Capacity

For more information on current capacity numbers, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR RAN.

Capacity and Performance

If the gaps between downlink traffic bursts are not enough to fulfill the requests of

the radio unit, the NR RU Intelligent Temperature Handling function forcefully

blanks some PDSCH slots. These slots are counted by the

NRCellDU.pmRadioPdschEmptySlotsForced PM counter. Because

temperature change is a slower process compared to slot scheduling, the downlink

PDSCH scheduling algorithm does not need to react immediately. It can select which

PDSCH slot to forcefully blank.

Forcefully

blanked slots result in increased downlink latency. Peak downlink throughput and

downlink cell capacity are also reduced.

In case the gaps between traffic bursts allow enough empty slots, the NR RU

Intelligent Temperature Handling function uses these empty slots to fulfill the

request of the radio unit. In this case, there is no impact on capacity and

throughput.

Interfaces

Uplink SINR-based coverage evaluation and SR periodicity reconfiguration might lead

to increased signaling over the Uu interface.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters of Scheduler High-Band

The feature uses attributes to control RF output power in the uplink

channel.

# 6 Performance of Scheduler High-Band

Performance management entities measure the number of empty PDSCH slots, the SR PUCCH

resource and beam switching.

KPIs

The NR RU Intelligent Temperature Handling function can degrade the KPIs for downlink

latency, cell, and UE downlink throughput. The number of forcefully blanked slots

indicates the grade of impact on these KPIs.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 20.Q1: Downlink Component Aggregation in High-Band

In High-Band, independent component carriers can be aggregated in the downlink.

Downlink component aggregation can improve downlink throughput and carrier

utilization.

| Access Type:            | NR                                     |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Feature Name:           | Scheduler High-Band                    |
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4904                           |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package                        |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002                           |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                    |
| Licensing:              | Basic feature. No license is required. |

If downlink component aggregation is active, data transmissions and re-transmissions can

be scheduled at the same time on different carriers.

Benefits

Downlink component aggregation can have the following benefits:

- Increased throughput in the downlink
- Increased slot utilization
- Fair slot distribution

Capacity and Performance

Maximum throughput increases with downlink component aggregation.

Operation

The operation of downlink component aggregation affects scheduling priority besides

the use of carriers and downlink slots:

- The same scheduling priority is assigned to new and retransmitted data
- New and retransmitted data are co-scheduled for the same device in the same slot to increase the use of carriers
- The co-scheduling of new and retransmitted data occurs in all downlink slots and all carriers

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

Downlink component aggregation requires the support of an EN-DC-capable UE.

## Appendix A.b: 20.Q1: Uplink Link Adaptation Improvements for High-Band

Uplink link adaptation improvements allow for the gNodeB to determine the number of

used layers for optimal uplink PRB allocation.

| Access Type:            | NR                                     |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Feature Name:           | Scheduler High-Band                    |
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4904                           |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package                        |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002                           |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                    |
| Licensing:              | Basic feature. No license is required. |

The gNodeB can determine how many layers it uses for PUSCH PRB transmissions. The

decision on the number of used layers is based on actual SINR and SINR difference

measurements on PUSCH DMRS.

Benefits

Uplink link adaptation improvements allow for the dynamic use of layers in the

uplink. The gNodeB uses two layers when SINR measurements allow. However, it reverts

to the use of a single layer when this option is more reliable for transmission.

Capacity and Performance

Using two layers in uplink link adaptation improves uplink throughput. Using a single

layer when conditions do not allow for two layers improves robustness.

Operation

The gNodeB selects the most suitable layer for single-layer transmission based on

SINR and SINR difference measurements. It uses the average measured SINR to select

the MCS while using two layers.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.c: 20.Q4: Periodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH in High-Band

Scheduling Requests constitute a set of PUCCH resources transmitted across different

bandwidth parts and cells. The Scheduling Request PUCCH resource is periodic, and can also

be multiplexed on aperiodic HARQ-ACK PUCCH resources.

| Access Type:            | NR                    |

This feature enhancement allows the network to perform the following actions:

- Configure the UE to transmit the Scheduling Request on the Scheduling Request PUCCH resources
- Decode a pending Scheduling Request on the periodic Scheduling Request PUCCH resource from multiple UEs at the same time

The UE can also multiplex Scheduling Request information. Multiplexing occurs on a

HARQ-ACK PUCCH resource, overlapping in time. The network decodes this Scheduling

Request together with the HARQ-ACK PUCCH resource without negative effect on legacy

PUCCH resources. The periodic Scheduling Request PUCCH resource is supported on the 4

downlink + 1 uplink TDD pattern in High-Band. However, it is not supported on the legacy

3 downlink + 1 uplink TDD pattern.

Benefits

The transmission of periodic and multiplexed Scheduling Request information increases

the probability for the UE to receive the scheduling grant from the gNodeB. The periodic Scheduling Request PUCCH resource can

decrease the latency of devices using C-DRX.

Capacity and Performance

The following counters are introduced for the measurement of the periodic Scheduling

Request PUCCH resource:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSrNote: It is possible that the UE fails to access the node by the Scheduling Request over PUCCH. In such cases, the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSr counter counts the number of received Scheduling Requests over the RACH. This counter is also triggered if a UE performs beam failure recovery within the same wide beam.
- NRCellDU.pmMacPucchSrPuschGrantLatDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlUnresUePucchSrGrant

This enhancement allows non-active UEs to be scheduled directly on the MCS most

suitable for the UE, as the gNodeB is aware of its pending

uplink data. In cells with good radio conditions, this results in more pegs on

higher MCSs in the NRCellDU.pmRadioPuschTable1McsDistr

counter.

The NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalMenb counter can be increased with

the same value as the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSr counter in the

following cases:

- A high number of active UEs (above 30) are in a cell.
- Traffic patterns manifest bursty data.

The impact of this function on the

NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSr counter is not expected to be

high.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 20.2 is supported by this enhancement.

## Appendix A.d: 21.Q1: Improved SCell Downlink Throughput

The enhancement provides higher downlink throughput with the use of the empty

overlapping CSI-RS symbols for PDSCH data transmission in SCells.

| Feature Name:           | Scheduler High-Band       |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4904              |
| Value Package Name:     | NR High-Band Base Package |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002              |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node       |
| Access Type:            | NR                        |

The enhancement increases the downlink throughput by using overlapping CSI-RS symbols on

SCells when performing beam management procedures.

Benefits

The downlink throughput is expected to increase when using Downlink Carrier

Aggregation. The relative throughput gain increases with the number of connected

users.

Capacity and Performance

The expected downlink throughput gain up to 10% depending on the configuration.

The sector carrier allocation on different PAAM and PAAM segments must be considered

during configuration.

Operation

The enhancement uses empty symbols, in mainly CSI-RS slots, on SCells in the

following cases:

- Overlapping with PSCell CSI-RS slots in beam tracking procedures
- Overlapping with PDCCH for uplink DCI
- Overlapping link adaptation CSI-RS symbols

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Other Network Elements

This enhancement requires an EN-DC-capable UE to operate.

## Appendix A.e: 22.Q1: Improved Periodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH in High-Band

The feature enhancement improves the ability of the gNodeB to handle situations when

the UE is unable to send periodic scheduling requests.

| Feature Name:           | Scheduler High-Band   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4904          |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package       |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002          |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node   |
| Access Type:            | NR                    |

Summary and Benefits

The Periodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH function of the Scheduler High-Band feature

cannot operate when the UE loses connection to the gNodeB for longer time periods.

This feature enhancement improves the ability of the gNodeB to keep the UE connected

to NR, when the UE sends periodic scheduling requests.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement increases the value of the SCG Active Radio Resource

Retainability, Captured in gNodeB KPI. The value of the KPI increases when the

Periodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH for High-Band function is active and the value

of the pmRadioPucchFailSr PM counter is high.

The following PM counters can be used to observe the feature enhancement:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchSrResourcesRestoredDistr
- NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalMenb

When a scheduling request is detected on RACH, RRC reconfiguration is activated for

the UE and the pmRadioPucchFailSr PM counter is pegged.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces observability for each C-RNTI based on the number

of RRC reconfigurations performed. If the value of the

pmRadioPucchFailSr PM counter is abnormally high, the

pmRadioPucchSrResourcesRestoredDistr PM counter can be

checked to determine if this is caused by UE impact or radio conditions.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 21.1 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

## Appendix A.f: 24.Q1.0: Coverage-Adaptive SR Periodicity for High-Band

The feature enhancement allows the operator to configure a threshold to adjust the

Scheduling Request (SR) periodicity depending on the radio conditions.

| Feature Name           | Scheduler High-Band   |
|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4904          |
| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package       |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4002          |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node   |
| Access Type            | NR                    |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional              |

Summary and Benefits

As a result of failed periodic SRs on PUCCH, the number of abnormal UE releases in

High-Band is increased where the cell edge radio conditions are not good enough for

the UE to get its SR requests served.

The feature enhancement introduces the SrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg

MO so that the operator can enable the functionality and configure a threshold for

determining the quality of UE coverage. The gNodeB selects the SR periodicity based

on the radio channel quality of the UE. If a UE is estimated to be in limited

coverage according to the threshold configured by the operator, the SR periodicity

is increased to the longest possible periodicity. When the UE returns to good radio

conditions, the shorter SR periodicity is reconfigured.

The feature enhancement provides the benefit of decreasing the number of abnormal UE

releases at the cell edge.

The feature enhancement is adapted to the UE Grouping Framework.

The feature enhancement does not support NR standalone High-Band deployments.

Capacity and Performance

If the value of the SCG Active Radio Resource Retainability, Captured in gNodeB KPI

decreases when the Periodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH for High-Band function is

activated, the value of this KPI is expected to increase when the feature

enhancement is active.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the SrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg

MO and the following attributes, which are related to enabling and configuring the

SR periodicity threshold:

- SrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg.covAdaptSrPEnabled
- SrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg.covAdaptSrPNrLowQualThresh
- SrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg.covAdaptSrPNrQualHyst
- SrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg.covAdaptSrPStartRsrpThresh

The feature enhancement introduces the following PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacSrPeriodicitySwitchLimitedCoverage
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacSrPeriodicitySwitchGoodCoverage
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacLongPsrSinrDistr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacShortPsrSinrDistr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacLongPsrRsrpDistr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacShortPsrRsrpDistr

The introduced PM counters can be used to observe the number of SR periodicity

switches that are caused by the following factors:

- Radio condition changes
- The distribution of SINR and RSRP values measured at the time of reconfiguring the SR based on PUCCH periodicity

The feature enhancement updates the DuPerCellTrafficRep PM event

with event parameters that are related to the RRCReconfiguration

message.

Interfaces

Uplink SINR-based coverage evaluation and SR periodicity reconfiguration might lead

to increased signaling over the Uu interface.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.10 or later to

support the MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.

| Access Type            | NR                    |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory             |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement introduces a set of predefined thresholds based on the

measured SINR and the SINR difference between two uplink layers. If the measured

SINR difference is larger than the predefined threshold, the UE reverts to the use

of a single layer for transmissions. The UE continues to transmit on a single uplink

layer until the measured SINR difference is below the predefined threshold.

Capacity and Performance

The increased chance of using two-layer transmissions improves NR uplink throughput.

Uplink throughput KPIs can be affected.

## Appendix A.h: 25.Q1.0: Enhanced Uplink Throughput with Support for 66 PRBs in High-Band

The feature enhancement increases the number of PRBs utilized for the Scheduler

High-Band feature.

| Access Type            | NR                    |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory             |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement increases the maximum number of PRBs used from 64 to 66 in

the uplink for High-Band, which increases uplink throughput.

The feature enhancement is applicable for cells with 100 MHz bandwidth

configuration.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement increases uplink peak throughput.

The maximum number of 66 PRBs cannot be used in the following cases:

- One uplink PRB is sometimes occupied in the Ericsson resource grid, and this is more common with more connected UEs. With fewer connected UEs in the cell, 66 PRBs are used, otherwise 65 PRBs.
- When the LinkAdaptationUeCfg.linkAdaptationUeMode attribute is set to ROBUST\_BASIC or ROBUST\_HIGH, or if the LinkAdaptationUeCfg.linkAdaptationUeMode attribute is set to CUSTOM and the UlLinkAdaptation.ulBlerTarget attribute is less than 10%, a maximum of 65 PRBs are used.
- When DFTS-OFDM waveform is used, the maximum number of uplink PRBs is 64, according to 3GPP.

The increased uplink throughput can be observed through the following PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPuschTypeB
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUl

The feature enhancement is expected to have a slight impact on the

NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUtilUlDistr PM counter.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory             |

Summary and Benefits

In high-load cases, CSI-RS and CSI reports from UEs can take up a lot of uplink and

downlink scheduling resources. This leads to an inefficient utilization of uplink

and downlink resources, as less data can be transferred.

The feature enhancement enables longer CSI periodicity in a cell in high-load

cases.

The feature enhancement is applicable for High-Band in NR standalone and EN-DC

deployments.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits in high-load cases:
