Summary

The feature introduces EBS counters to monitor uplink and downlink user plane traffic for VoNR

on DRBs with ROHC profile 1.

The following characteristics of the user plane traffic can be observed:

- Consecutive RTP packet loss with and without PDCP packets loss in downlink and uplink
- PDCP packet gaps in downlink and uplink

The feature provides more detailed information about the downlink and uplink user

plane traffic on DRBs that are used for VoNR.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Enhanced Voice Observability

The feature allows the monitoring of

uplink

and downlink VoNR traffic on DRBs with ROCH profile 1.

The feature provides detailed information on consecutive RTP packet loss and PDCP packet

gap. Observability is supported through EBS counters and PM events.

Consecutive RTP Packet Loss

The feature allows the detection and reporting of consecutive RTP packet loss. RTP

packet loss can be detected even if there is no PDCP packet loss.

The feature reports the consecutive RTP packet loss in 1-second and 10-second

reports.

When more than one instance of consecutive RTP packet loss occurs in 1 second, the

instance with the highest number of missing packets is reported as the maximum

consecutive RTP packet loss. In the 10-second report, the maximum consecutive RTP

packet loss is a list of the 1-second maximum consecutive RTP packet loss

values.

Total RTP Packet Loss

Total RTP packet loss is calculated as the sum of all lost packets over a 1-second

period. The 10-second report shows the sum of packets lost across all the 1-second

periods in that 10-second period.

PDCP Packet Gap

The feature can detect and report the time of each PDCP packet gap. PDCP packet gap

occurs when no PDCP packet is transferred between two packets or a packet and the

DRB release.

PDCP packet gaps are reported in 10-second reports.

In the report, the maximum PDCP packet gap time is a list of the 1-second maximum

PDCP packet gap time values.

Figure 1   PDCP Packet Gap Time

The reported information on RTP and PDCP packet loss is used to create counters and

PM Events. For more information, see Performance of NR Enhanced Voice Observability.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
