Summary

The Connected Mode DRX feature allows the UE to stop monitoring the PDCCH during certain

reoccurring time periods. The amount of battery time saved depends on the following

factors:

- Individual device implementation
- Feature configuration
- Type of traffic

Web-browsing traffic typically has more significant saving potential than continuous download

traffic.

DRX can only be applied in RRC\_CONNECTED mode.

Hardware

No specific hardware

requirements.

Limitations

The following limitations apply to the feature:

- The DRX offset can be configured individually for each UE by the gNodeB. Other configurable parameters are the same for all UEs.
- Only a long DRX cycle is supported.
- Only the Long DRX Command MAC CE (Control Element) is supported, and only for High-Band networks.
- Switching between downlink MCG and SCG resources can have impact on the Connected Mode DRX feature. Aperiodic Channel State Information measurements trigger the inactivity timer, shortening the Opportunity for DRX period. This results in higher UE energy consumption.

Network Requirements

The UE must use FGIs to indicate proven support for DRX.

# 3 Feature Operation of Connected Mode DRX

The Connected Mode DRX feature reduces energy consumption by the periodic control of

radio monitoring in the UE.

The Connected Mode DRX feature is configured by the gNodeB if the

UE indicates capability support for a long DRX cycle. It is also necessary to enable DRX

by setting the DrxProfileUeCfg.drxEnabled attribute. The UE can stop

monitoring PDCCH for downlink scheduling assignments and uplink grants when it is

configured for DRX operations while in RRC\_CONNECTED mode. This means

that the UE can turn off its radio receiver to save energy.

The time periods when the radio receiver is turned off are configured by the network.

When DRX is configured, the following two DRX states are possible for a specific UE in a

DRX cycle:

| Active Time         |    | During this period, the UE turns on its radio receiver to monitor PDCCH.                                         |
|---------------------|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                     |    |                                                                                                                  |
| Opportunity for DRX |    | During this period, the UE does not need to turn on the radio receiver to                         monitor PDCCH. |

The gNodeB schedules the UE for uplink or downlink transmissions

in its Active Time periods.

The following Active Time periods of the UE can occur:

- The inactivity timer period. It is started by the UE upon successful reception of the PDCCH. The PDCCH contains a downlink assignment or an uplink grant for new data transmission.
- The period when the UE waits for the downlink retransmission scheduling of a downlink HARQ process. This period occurs if the decoding of such a HARQ process fails. It is defined by the DRX retransmission timers for the uplink and the downlink. These timers are not used. Although these timers are sent to the UE, their roles are replaced by the inactivity timer.
- The contention resolution period. It specifies the time when the UE waits for PDCCH transmission addressed to the C-RNTI after Msg3 transmission. This period is defined by the ra-ContentionResolutionTimer.
- The period after which the UE sends a Scheduling Request (SR) on PUCCH, while the SR is pending.

The DRX cycle specifies the periodic repetition of the On Duration period, in which the

UE monitors PDCCH. This is followed by a period for DRX opportunity.

Figure 1   DRX Cycle

Within the DRX cycle, the On Duration period starts with a delay compared to the

beginning of the full DRX cycle. This delay is specified by the DRX offset. The DRX

offset is configured by the gNodeB to ensure spreading the On

Duration periods of different devices in time.

NR PDCCH link adaptation is based on downlink channel quality measurements. If downlink

data transmission is continuous, the UE remains awake by prolonging the inactivityTimer

until it expires. In this way, the UE can continue to provide downlink channel quality

measurements. Therefore, the NR PDCCH link adaptation algorithm can be based on

up-to-date channel quality measurements.

In DRX off duration, the UE can remain in sleep mode for a prolonged period of time,

unless it is waken. This can be triggered by uplink data transmission or by starting an

onDuration period. In such cases, NR PDCCH link adaptation can be based on outdated

channel quality measurements until the UE receives up-to-date measurements.

Operational Process for NR NSA

Figure 2   Operational Sequence Diagram for NR NSA

1. The RRC connection is established between the UE and the eNodeB.
2. The eNodeB forwards a Secondary gNodeB Addition Request over the X2-AP interface to the gNodeB.
    1. The UE context is established in the gNodeB. The UE capability is checked for DRX support.
3. The gNodeB acknowledges the Secondary gNodeB Addition Request.
4. The eNodeB initiates RRC Connection Reconfiguration towards the UE.
5. The UE receives the DRX configuration.
6. The UE completes the RRC Connection Reconfiguration.
7. The UE enters the DRX cycle.

Operational Process for NR SA

In the NR SA setup, DRX configuration is signaled to the UE in the RRC

Reconfiguration message. The UE enters a long DRX cycle after receiving DRX

configuration in RRC signaling. DRX is activated on the gNodeB after it receives the RRC Reconfiguration Complete message from the UE.

Figure 3   Operational Sequence Diagram for NR SA

1. The gNodeB-CU-CP sends the gNodeB-DU the UE Context Setup Request message.
2. The DRX-Config is sent from the gNodeB-DU to the gNodeB-CU-CP in the UE Context Setup Response message.
3. The gNodeB-CU-CP sends the gNodeB-DU the downlink RRC message.
4. The gNodeB-DU sends the UE the RRC Reconfiguration message. It includes the DRX-Config.
5. The UE sends the gNodeB-DU the RRC Reconfiguration Complete message.
6. The gNodeB-DU sends the gNodeB-CU-CP the uplink RRC message.
7. The gNodeB-CU-CP sends the gNodeB-DU the UE Context Modification Request message, which indicates the completion of RRC reconfiguration. Note: With the completion of this step, DRX is activated on the gNodeB.
8. The gNodeB-DU sends the gNodeB-CU-CP the UE Context Modification Response message.
9. The gNodeB-CU-CP sends the AMF the Initial Context Setup Response message.

## 3.1 Inactivity Timer Period

The PDCCH can indicate a new transmission (either DL-SCH or UL-SCH). The UE starts or

restarts the inactivity timer period in the first symbol after the end of the PDCCH

reception. In the inactivity timer period, the UE remains awake until the period

expires.

The long DRX cycle is independent of the inactivity timer period. Therefore, when the

inactivity timer period expires, the long DRX cycle continues in the background.

Figure 4   Inactivity Timer Period

## 3.2 Inactivity Timer Period with Long DRX Command

With the long DRX command, the gNodeB uses a MAC Channel Element (CE) to stop the

inactivity and the onDuration timers.

The inactivity and the onDuration timers are stopped by the Long DRX Command MAC CE if

the following conditions are true:

- The onDuration timer is active for the UE.
- No uplink or downlink traffic between the UE and the gNodeB.

This process has no impact on Round-Trip Time (RTT) and retransmission timers.

## 3.3 DRX Retransmission Timers

The DRX retransmission timers allow for further optimization of DRX settings to

reduce the UE battery consumption for specific services, such as VoNR, while maintaining a

good end-user experience.

UE battery performance and talk time can be improved by adjusting DRX timers to smaller

values. For more information related to the DRX attributes, see the following

documentation:

- 3GPP TS 38.331; NR; Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification

# 4 Network Impact of Connected Mode DRX

The Connected Mode

DRX feature decreases UE energy

consumption.

Capacity and Performance

- The feature reduces UE energy consumption.
- The feature increases latency in the following cases: The Connected Mode DRX feature is enabled while traffic with sudden peaks is scheduled. Newly transmitted traffic segments have to wait for the start of the next On Duration period to be scheduled. Connected Mode DRX is enabled with uplink prescheduling. The feature affects prescheduling. Connected Mode DRX with prescheduling provides a balance between UE battery consumption and UE latency.
- Connected Mode DRX balances the performance of radio resource switching and reduced UE energy consumption.
- The Connected Mode DRX feature with the Long DRX Command MAC CE further balances the improved responsiveness of chatty applications and reduced UE energy consumption.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

Framework.

# 6 Performance of Connected Mode DRX

The Connected Mode DRX feature is associated with performance management entities

measuring the DRX sleep time of the

UEs.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

- NRCellDU.pmDrxTotalTime
- NRCellDU.pmDrxSleepTime

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Connected Mode DRX

## 8.1 Enable or Disable Connected Mode DRX

The Connected Mode DRX feature can be configured on a cell level.

Prerequisites

- The NRCellDU.drxProfileRef MO parameter is set to an instance of the DrxProfile MO.

Steps

- Enable the feature by setting the DrxProfileUeCfg.drxEnabled MO parameter to true.
- Disable the feature by setting the DrxProfileUeCfg.drxEnabled MO parameter to false.

## 8.2 Configure Connected Mode DRX

The length of the Connected Mode DRX-related periods can be configured in the

MOM.

Steps

1. Configure the long DRX cycle by setting the DrxProfileUeCfg.drxLongCycle attribute. The following values are supported: For High-Band networks: 80 ms (default setting) For Mid-Band networks: 160 ms For Low-Band networks: 160 ms
2. Configure the On Duration period by setting the DrxProfileUeCfg.drxOnDurationTimer attribute. The following values are supported: For High-Band networks: 2 ms and 8 ms (default setting) For Mid-Band networks: 10 ms For Low-Band networks: 10 ms
3. Configure the inactivity timer period by setting the DrxProfileUeCfg.drxInactivityTimer attribute. The following values are supported: For High-Band networks: 8-60 ms Default setting: 8 ms Recommended setting: 30 ms For Mid-Band networks: 100 ms For Low-Band networks: 100 ms

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 21.Q2: Improved UE Responsiveness by Configuring the DRX Inactivity Timer

This feature enhancement allows for a better balance between UE battery consumption

and responsiveness, primarily for chatty applications. The enhancement is only supported on

High-Band.

| Feature Name:           | Connected Mode DRX                          |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4963                                |
| Value Package Name:     | NR High-Band Base Package                   |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ                             801 4002/5H |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                         |
| Access Type:            | NR                                          |
| Licensing:              | Basic feature. No license is required.      |

Benefits

This feature enhancement improves the responsiveness of applications by allowing the

NRCellDU.drxInactivityTimer attribute to be configured for

higher values. This reduces the chance of the UE entering connected mode DRX sleep

between incoming data bursts.

If the onDuration timer is active for the UE and the UE is found to be inactive, it

can be forced to enter DRX sleep, using the Long DRX Command MAC CE. This can

maintain or improve UE battery consumption.

Capacity and Performance

If the feature enhancement is active, the downlink cell throughput can decrease with

a few percent. This effect is directly proportional to the number of inactive users.

This is caused by sending MAC CE to the inactive users, which decreases the

capactity for sending data to other users.

Operation

The feature enhancement allows the NRCellDU.drxInactivityTimer

attribute to be set between 8 ms and 60 ms. The default value of the

NRCellDU.drxInactivityTimer attribute is 8 ms to align with

legacy performance. The recommended setting is 30 ms.

The feature enhancement uses the Long DRX Command MAC CE to force inactive UE back to

connected mode DRX sleep.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

This feature enhancement can only operate on UE that support EN-DC.

## Appendix A.b: 22.Q2: DRX Retransmission Timer

This enhancement makes it possible to optimize the DRX settings to reduce the UE

battery consumption, while maintaining a good end-user experience.
