Summary

To increase the security observability of the system, this feature introduces a tool

to monitor system calls. Suspicious system calls are detected and logged in the

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) log.

This feature has the following benefits:

- Early detection of potential cyber attacks
- More awareness of what happens in the system during intrusions
- Increased observability of the node
- Early notifications in case something goes wrong
- Quick response to incidents by increased visibility of the system

# 3 Feature Operation of Integrated Endpoint Detection and Response

The system call monitoring functionality consists of detection data export process

and EDR system configuration process.

Detection Data Export

The export of detection data is achieved through

following

processes:

1. The node runs an analysis tool that monitors system calls in the Baseband, which provides a host-based intrusion detection functionality.
2. Suspicious system calls are processed, and the detected suspicious events are formatted into syslog format.
3. EDR logs are streamed and collected through the RTSEL interface by a syslog server which can be ESM or any Security Information and Event Management system. EDR logs can be sent in BULK instead of STREAM to the ENM when the log file is full if the real-time detection is not needed. For details about the process, see Manage Software.

Table 2 shows the message types that can

appear in the EDR log and examples of actions that trigger the message.
