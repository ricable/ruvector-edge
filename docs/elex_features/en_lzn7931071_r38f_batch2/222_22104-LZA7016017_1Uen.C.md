Summary

This feature introduces EBS counters to improve the end-to-end observability of the

usage of network slices based on the S-NSSAI of the established PDU sessions.

This feature provides the following benefits:

- Through the pmEbsRrcConnLevelSnssaiMax EBS counter the highest number of connected UEs in a network slice can be observed.
- Through the pmEbsRrcConnLevelSnssaiSum EBS counter the average number of connected UEs in a network slice can be calculated.
- The CuCpPerCellRrcConnectedUe PM event is updated to monitor the number of RRC connected users in the NR cell.

# 2 Dependencies of NR Service-Differentiated Observability for RRC Connected Users

This feature improves the observability of network slices enabled by the RAN Slicing

Framework feature.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Service-Differentiated Observability for RRC Connected Users

The feature introduces EBS counters to measure the highest number and the average

number of RRC connected UEs for each network slice.

The introduced EBS counters show the peak and accumulated number of RRC connected UEs for

each network slice in the NR cell.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Service-Differentiated Observability for RRC Connected Users

The feature has no impact on the network.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Service-Differentiated Observability for RRC Connected Users

The feature has no associated parameters.

There are no introduced, affecting, or affected parameters associated with this

feature.

# 6 Performance of NR Service-Differentiated Observability for RRC Connected Users

This feature is associated with EBS counters and a PM event to measure network slice

usage.

Key Performance Indicators

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The following EBS counters are introduced to monitor the number of RRC connected UEs

for each network slice:

- pmEbsRrcConnLevelSnssaiMax
- pmEbsRrcConnLevelSnssaiSum

For more information on EBS counters associated with the feature, see Lists and Delta Lists.

Events

The CuCpPerCellRrcConnectedUe PM event is updated to report the number of RRC

connected UEs for each S-NSSAI of the established PDU sessions.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
