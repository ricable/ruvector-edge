units.

The following configurations are supported:

- Multiple sectors in one 2TX/2RX radio
- Multiple sectors in one 4TX/4RX radio
- Multiple sectors in one 6TX/6RX radio, for example Radio 6626
- Multiple sectors in one 8TX/8RX radio

For more information on RBBs and combining different radio units for multi-sector

configurations, see Radio Node Configurations.

## 3.1 Multi-Sector Configurations Using 2TX/2RX Radio Units

Example of configuring multiple sectors using a 2TX/2RX radio unit.

Sector equipment functions are used to configure the system by involving the used

SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attributes. One or two

RfBranch MOs are added if the RfPort of the

RfBranch has both capability of TX and RX.

To arrange the two-sector configuration for one 2TX/2RX radio unit, the

SectorEquipmentFunction MOs must be created to represent the two

sectors. Each SectorEquipmentFunction MO must contain

SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attributes representing the

number of the antenna branches that the sector carriers have in the given sector.

The SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attributes reference different

instances of the RfBranch MO under the

AntennaUnitGroup MO. Each instance of the

RfBranch MO references one RfPort MO on the

radio

unit.

## 3.2 Multi-Sector Configurations Using 4TX/4RX Radio Units

Example of configuring multiple sectors using a 4TX/4RX radio unit.

In a multi-sector configuration, one 4TX/4RX radio unit has two sectors. Each sector has

one or more sector carriers with two antenna branches each. The radio unit is connected

to one radio node.

Figure 1   Multi-Sector Configuration on One 4TX/4RX Radio Unit

To arrange the two-sector configuration for one 4TX/4RX radio unit, two

SectorEquipmentFunction MOs must be created to represent the two

sectors. Each SectorEquipmentFunction MO must contain two

SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attributes representing the

number of the antenna branches that the sector carriers have in the given sector.

The SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attributes reference different

instances of the RfBranch MO under the

AntennaUnitGroup MO. Each instance of the

RfBranch MO references one RfPort MO on the

radio

unit.

## 3.3 Multi-Sector Configurations Using 8TX/8RX Radio Units

Example of configuring multiple sectors using a 8TX/8RX radio unit.

One 8TX/8RX radio unit connecting to one radio node is capable of supporting the

following multi-sector configurations:

- Two sectors on one radio unit. Each sector has one or more sector carriers with four antenna branches.
- Three sectors on one radio unit. Two of them have one or more sector carriers respectively, each with two antenna branches. One of them has one or more sector carriers with four antenna branches.
- Four sectors within one radio unit. Each sector has one or more sector carriers with two antenna branches.

Figure 2   Multi-Sector Configurations on One 8TX/8RX Radio Unit

To arrange multi-sector configurations for one 8TX/8RX radio unit, the number of the

SectorEquipmentFunction MOs created and configured must

correspond to the number of sectors. For example, two sectors, each with one or more

sector carriers having four antenna branches, require the configuration of two instances

of the SectorEquipmentFunction MO.

In one SectorEquipmentFunction MO, which represents one sector, the

number of SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attributes must

correspond to the number of the antenna branches that the sector carriers have in the

given sector. For example, in case of two instances of the

SectorEquipmentFunction MO, each has to contain four

SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attributes.

The SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attributes reference different

instances of the RfBranch MO under the

AntennaUnitGroup MO. Each instance of the

RfBranch MO references one RfPort MO on the

radio

unit.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Multi-Sector Per Radio

The feature in NR can be configured to have multiple sectors.

## 8.1 Configure Multi-Sector Per Radio on One Radio Unit in NR

By configuring the Multi-Sector Per Radio feature in NR, multiple sectors can be set

up on Remote radio units with external antenna.

Prerequisites

- The NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute is set to LOCKED.
- The NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState attribute is set to LOCKED.
- The number of NRSectorCarrier MOs created and configured corresponds to the number of required sectors.
- The number of NRCellDU MOs created and configured corresponds to the number of required sectors if the cell is not a combined cell.
- All instances of the NRCellDU MO have their corresponding NRCellCU MOs.
- The NRCellDU.nRSectorCarrierRef attribute has a reference to an instance of the NRSectorCarrier MO or MOs.
- The Multi-Sector Per Radio feature is operable on the Baseband Radio Node.

Steps

1. Create as many instances of the SectorEquipmentFunction MO as the number of required sectors on the radio unit.
2. Set each NRSectorCarrier.sectorEquipmentFunctionRef attribute to reference a respective instance of the SectorEquipmentFunction MO.
3. Create as many instances of the RfBranch MO as the number of RfPort MO instances on the radio unit.
4. Configure each RfBranch.rfPortRef attribute, so that one attribute references one corresponding instance of the RfPort MO.
5. Configure the SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attributes in each MO instance to reference the number of RfBranch MOs one sector requires.
6. Configure the SectorEquipmentFunction.configuredOutputPower attribute in all sectors.
7. Set the SectorEquipmentFunction.administrativeState to UNLOCKED for all sectors. Note: Unlocking the SectorEquipmentFunction MO can take longer than normal if the associated radio unit restarts during the deactivation of the Radio Deep Sleep Mode feature.
8. Set the NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState to UNLOCKED for the sector carriers in all sectors.
9. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState to UNLOCKED for all cells on which the sector carriers are deployed.

Results

The radio unit is configured to have multiple sectors.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: Support for Two WCDMA Sectors with RRUS 12 and RRUS A3

| Access Type:       | LTE, WCDMA                           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Hardware Platform: | RRUS 12 and RRUS A3                  |
| Licensing:         | Multi-Sector Per Radio, FAJ 121 3088 |

This is an improvement to the Multi-Sector Per Radio feature. It enables support for a

radio group of two radios with 2 TX/2 RX + 0 TX/2 RX antenna branches, for example RRUS

12 and RRUS A3, as two sectors for WCDMA on Baseband nodes with single RAT or multi RAT

configurations. The sectors can be either single mode or mixed mode.

The enhancement lowers cost and power consumption for multi-sector deployments.

units can be set up to support multiple

sectors.

| Feature Name:           | Multi-Sector Per Radio       |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3088                 |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Low/Mid-Band Base Package |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002/5LM             |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node          |

One 4TX/4RX radio unit connecting to one Baseband Radio Node is capable of supporting a

two-sector configuration in NR. Each sector has one sector carrier with two antenna

branches.

By connecting a number of 4TX/4RX radio units to one Baseband Radio Node, the following

multi-sector configurations can be set up:

- Four sectors on two 4TX/4RX radio units.
- Six sectors on three 4TX/4RX radio units.

Benefits

Improved coverage can be achieved by enabling the configuration of multiple sectors

on 4TX/4RX radio units.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The number of the SectorEquipmentFunction MO instances represents

the available sectors on a 4TX/4RX radio unit. Each

NRSectorCarrier MO instance references one

SectorEquipmentFunction MO in a given sector.

The number of SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attributes in

each instance of this MO must correspond to the number of the antenna branches the

sector carrier has in one sector. Each attribute references a single

RfBranch MO that represents one antenna branch for the sector

carrier. The total number of the RfBranch MOs on a 4TX/4RX radio

unit is four.

Each instance of the RfBranch MOs references an

RfPort MO on the same 4TX/4RX radio unit. All the instances

of the RfBranch MO are grouped under the

AntennaUnitGroup MO.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.c: 20.Q2: Multi-Sector Support on 8TX/8RX Radio Units in NR

In NR, non-AAS radio units support multiple sector configurations. One 8TX/8RX radio

unit or a combination of 4TX/4RX and 8TX/8RX radio units can be set up to support multiple

sectors.

| Feature Name:           | Multi-Sector Per Radio       |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3088                 |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Low/Mid-Band Base Package |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002/5LM             |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node          |
| Access Type:            | NR                           |

One 8TX/8RX TDD radio unit connecting to one Baseband Radio Node is capable of supporting

the following multi-sector configurations:

- Two sectors on one radio unit. Each sector has one sector carrier with four antenna branches.
- Three sectors on one radio unit. Two of them have respective sector carriers, each with two antenna branches. One of them has one sector carrier with four antenna branches.
- Four sectors on one radio unit. Each sector has one sector carrier with two antenna branches. Note: The Baseband Radio Node supports three sector carriers to be unlocked.

The connection of different types of non-AAS TDD radio units to one Baseband Radio Node

is supported. Each radio unit corresponds to one or more sectors. Each sector

corresponds to one cell on which a sector carrier is deployed. In NR, a three-sector

configuration can be achieved by the following combinations of the different radio unit

types connected to a Baseband Radio Node:

- One 8TX/8RX radio unit with two sectors + one 4TX/4RX radio unit with one sector.
- One 8TX/8RX radio unit with two sectors + one 8TX/8RX radio unit with one sector.
- One 8TX/8RX radio unit with two sectors + one 8TX/8RX radio unit also with two sectors, one of which is connected to the Baseband Radio Node.

Benefits

Improved coverage can be achieved by enabling the configuration of multiple sectors

on one 8TX/8RX radio unit and on a combination of 4TX/4RX and 8TX/8RX radio

units.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The number of the SectorEquipmentFunction MO instances represents

the available sectors on an 8TX/8RX radio unit. Each

NRSectorCarrier MO instance references one

SectorEquipmentFunction MO in a given sector.

The number of SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attributes in

each instance of this MO must correspond to the number of the antenna branches the

sector carrier has in one sector. Each attribute references a single

RfBranch MO that represents one antenna branch for the sector

carrier. The total number of the RfBranch MOs on an 8TX/8RX radio

unit is eight.

Each instance of the RfBranch MOs references an

RfPort MO on the same 8TX/8RX radio unit. All the instances

of the RfBranch MO are grouped under the

AntennaUnitGroup MO.
