Summary

The feature

provides

automation functionality

to

configure and manage the NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode feature.

The feature introduces an intent-based solution for the management of NR energy efficiency

features to avoid complex configurations. The intent of the feature is an indicator

configured by the operator to attempt to maintain a certain level of user

experience. Based on the configured intent and the monitored user experience, the

feature automatically and continuously tunes the threshold parameters of NR energy

efficiency features to optimize energy performance. For more about the definition of

the intent and how to configure it, see

Automated Energy

Saver.

# 2 Dependencies of Automated Energy Saver

Hardware

The feature is supported only on radio units that support the

NR

Massive MIMO Sleep Mode feature.

Limitations

The feature inherits the limitations of the

NR

Massive MIMO Sleep Mode feature.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of Automated Energy Saver

When the Automated Energy Saver feature is enabled, the threshold parameters of NR

energy efficiency features are tuned automatically in a periodic manner.

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 1   Automated Energy Saver Flowchart

Process Steps

1. The NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode feature is activated, configured, and enabled.
2. According to the conditions in the target network, nodes, and cells, the operator intent is configured by creating and configuring the following attributes: Aes.targetUeDlThroughput Aes.targetUeRatio The feature is enabled by the Aes.aesEnabled attribute.
3. The feature calculates user experience and makes a decision: The feature calculates node and cell level user experience for the last updated period, which is 15 minutes. The feature analyzes the node and cell level user experience and the fulfillment of operator intent. According to the analysis, the feature provides decision for tuning the threshold parameters of the energy efficiency feature. The feature introduces the following MO class and PM event for the operator to monitor the performance of the feature: MO class: AesMMimoSleep PM event: DuCellAesMonitorRep
4. Based on the decision, the feature updates the thresholds of the NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode feature in the following way: If the decision is to activate the TX mute function less to maintain the user experience, the thresholds are decreased. If the decision is to activate the TX mute function more, the thresholds are increased. The thresholds are represented by the AesMMimoSleep.switchDownPrbThreshDl and the AesMMimoSleep.switchUpPrbThreshDl attributes.
5. The feature collects data during the 15-mintues period as input to make calculation and decision.

# 4 Network Impact of Automated Energy Saver

Capacity and Performance

The

Automated

Energy Saver feature controls the behavior of the NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode

feature. The negative effects on KPIs of the NR Massive MIMO

Sleep Mode feature are also applicable to the Automated Energy Saver feature.

The Filtered MBB DL MAC DRB Throughput KPI is expected to decrease to the level

defined by operator intent.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Automated Energy Saver

introduced by NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode are affected by or affecting Automated Energy

Saver.

Counters

The following EBS counters are associated with the feature:

- pmEbsnMacDrbThpDlMbbLowVolDistr
- PmEbsnDrbExclThpDlShortTimeLowVol
- PmEbsnDrbExclThpDlRelativeLowVol

It is recommended to have these counters to monitor user experience. For more

information on EBS counters associated with the feature, see Lists and Delta Lists.

The following PM counters can be used for monitoring the performance of this

feature:

- pmMassiveMimoSleepTimeTxMute
- pmConsumedEnergy
- pmPowerConsumption

Events

The

feature introduces the DuCellAesMonitorRep PM event for monitoring Automated Energy

Saver decision data:

# 7 Activate Automated Energy Saver

To use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation

procedure.

Prerequisites

- The NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode feature is activated, enabled on applicable cells. The time window is configured properly for NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode. For more information about how to configure the proper time window, see Engineering Guidelines for Automated Energy Saver.
- The license key is installed in the node.
- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the attribute FeatureState.featureState to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState = CXC 401 2755 MO instance.
2. Configure the operator intent. For more information about how to set the intent, see Engineering Guidelines for Automated Energy Saver.
3. Enable the feature by setting the MO parameter Aes.aesEnabled to true.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 8 Deactivate Automated Energy Saver

If the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual

feature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any

conflicting feature.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Disable the feature by setting the MO parameter Aes.aesEnabled to false.
2. Set the attribute FeatureState.featureState to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState = CXC 401 2755 MO instance.

After This Task

- If the operator still needs to use NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode, configure the feature manually.
- Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Automated Energy Saver

Intent Configuration for Automated Energy Saver

The operator intent is introduced by the feature to replace complex configuration

when setting the configurations for NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode. The Automated Energy

Saver checks the fulfillment of operator intent to dynamically tune the thresholds

of NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode.

The operator intent is defined as:

To configure the intent:

1. Set the downlink throughput level Aes.targetUeDlThroughput which ensures a satisfactory user experience for Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) users. The recommended value is 30 Mbps.
2. For each gNodeB, observe KPI Filtered MBB DL MAC DRB Throughput to check the ratio of users that reach the defined downlink throughput level.
3. For each gNodeB, set an acceptable ratio Aes.targetUeRatio which is lower than observed to allow the operation of energy efficiency features.

Set

the Time Window in NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode

The active time window of the Automated Energy Saver feature is aligned with the time

window set in MO classMMimoSleepTimeWindow. If Automated Energy

Saver is used, setting the time window of the NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode feature

closely affects the performance of Automated Energy Saver.

The Automated Energy Saver feature continuously tunes NR Massive MIMO Sleep Mode to

save energy consumption and to maintain user experience at the same time. As a

result, Automated Energy Saver offers the potential to use NR Massive MIMO Sleep

Mode in a wider window comparing to manually tune the feature. It is recommended to

set the time window based on past observation on using the NR Massive MIMO Sleep

Mode feature without Automated Energy Saver but set it wider than the original time

window.
