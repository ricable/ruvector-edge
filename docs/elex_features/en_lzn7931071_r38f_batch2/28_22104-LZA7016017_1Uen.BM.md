# 1 EMF Power Lock Mid-Band Overview

The EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature controls the sector carrier-wide, time-averaged

transmitted power of the NR AAS radio. The transmitted power is kept below a configured

level to meet EMF regulatory requirements.

Summary

The EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature uses a mechanism that limits the time-averaged

and sector carrier-wide transmitted power of the NR AAS radio. The mechanism does

not affect coverage and minimizes the impact on capacity. The feature enables

obtaining a certain Radio Frequency EMF exclusion zone by keeping the transmitted

power below the operator-defined level. This Radio Frequency EMF exclusion zone is

smaller than what is needed for the maximum power at the site where the radio is

planned to be deployed.

Regulations on Radio Frequency EMF exposure can be based on, for example, the ICNIRP

guidelines. These guidelines contain limits that include a certain averaging time.

The averaging time can vary depending on the frequency band.

The power determination and control take place in the Baseband

unit.

As the gNodeB currently supports one sector carrier for each cell, the following

items are implemented at sector carrier level in this feature:

- Power determination
- Back-off function
- Parameters
- PM counters
- PM events

Hardware

The feature is supported on all mid-band TDD radio products. For more information,

see Radio Node Configurations.

Limitations

- Only 30 kHz numerology is supported.
- Only TDD radio products are supported.
- The transmitted power is determined in the Baseband unit, not measured by the radio.
- Transmitted power is determined only for each sector carrier. The overall transmitted power is not determined.
- Beamforming is not considered in the power determination.
- Power boost is not considered in the power determination.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of EMF Power Lock Mid-Band

The feature keeps the sector carrier-wide, time-averaged transmitted power of the

radio node below a configured level.

Operational Process

The feature operation has the following steps:

1. Determination of the transmitted power at each control step
2. Determination of the time-averaged transmitted power
3. Control signal generation based on the comparison of the time-averaged transmitted power and the average total transmitted power set-point
4. Determination of the momentary output power based on the generated control signal

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The Baseband unit determines the transmitted power at each control step delivered by the radio. Determination is based on the resource use data provided by the scheduler output. The length of the sliding window for the time-averaged transmitted power determination can be configured between 30 seconds and 30 minutes. The configured time period for the time-averaged transmitted power must be consistent with the local regulatory requirements. This period can be set with the PowerBackoff.powerBackoffAvgTime attribute. The control step is determined by the averaging time.
2. The Baseband unit determines the time-averaged transmitted power. At each control step, a new determined power sample is provided to the sliding window and the oldest power sample is dropped. The time-averaged transmitted power over all the samples is provided to the backoff controller as input at every control step. In case of a 6-minute sliding window and a 0.6-second control step, the following equation determines the number of power samples used for time-averaged transmitted power determination: 6 × 60/0.6 = 600 Figure 2 EMF Sliding Window Method for Storing Power Samples
3. The backoff power controller generates a control signal at every control step that can influence the momentary output power through the dynamic threshold scheduler actuator. The input for this controller is the time-averaged transmitted power and the average total transmitted power set-point. This threshold is configured with the PowerBackoff.powerBackoffThresh attribute. The control signal of the backoff power controller is generated based on this input.
4. The dynamic threshold scheduler actuator can dynamically limit the number of scheduled PRBs at every control step. Changing the number of scheduled PRBs modifies the momentary output power. The dynamic threshold scheduler actuator uses the control signal of the backoff power controller as input for this function.

## 3.1 Comparison of the EMF Power Lock Mid-Band Feature and NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band Feature

Compared to the EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature, using the NR Directional Control for

EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature has less or no impact on the performance of the sector

carrier. This results in better throughput while the time-averaged and normalized EIRP is

maintained below the configured thresholds.

Using the EMF Power Lock Mid-Band Feature

With the EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature, the time-averaged and normalized power is

kept below the configured threshold in the sector carrier. The threshold, which is

configured with the PowerBackoff.powerBackoffThresh attribute,

determines what fraction of the maximum configured power can be used for

time-averaged power. The maximum configured power is configured with the

NRSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute.

For example, with a 25% threshold and a maximum configured power of 200 W, the

time-averaged transmitted power is kept below 50 W in the sector carrier, regardless

of reported PMIs, or whether codebook-based beamforming or advanced beamforming is

used.

Using the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band Feature

With the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature, the geographic

area of the sector is divided into eight directions. In each direction, the

threshold is configured with the

PowerBackoffDir.powerBackoffDirThresh attribute. The

time-averaged and normalized EIRP is kept below the threshold, and if the power

control is triggered in one direction, the momentary power is reduced in the whole

sector carrier.

Example 1

If the reported PMIs from UEs are evenly mapped among the directions, UEs only use

one-layer MIMO transmission, and the total power is evenly distributed among the UEs

as shown in Figure 3. If the TDD downlink

duty cycle is 0.75, the time-averaged and normalized EIRP in one direction is

roughly 0.75/8 = 0.094. The accurate time-averaged and normalized EIRP level

calculated in the EMF controller is slightly higher than 0.094, because it includes

the side lobe contributions from beams towards other directions. If the threshold is

25% in all directions, the power control is not triggered as the time-averaged and

normalized EIRP level calculated in any direction is below the 25%

threshold.

Figure 3   Reported PMIs from UEs Are Evenly Distributed

Example 2

If reported PMIs from UEs are unevenly mapped among the directions, the time-averaged

and normalized EIRP might approach the threshold in the direction with the most

usage, triggering power control. If the TDD downlink duty cycle is 0.75, and the

thresholds are 25% in all directions, with a 50% usage in direction 8, as shown in

Figure 4, the power control is then to

be triggered in the sector carrier to keep the time-averaged and normalized EIRP

below the threshold in direction 8.

Figure 4   Reported PMIs from UEs Are Unevenly Distributed

Example 3

Power control might not be triggered by the direction with a larger threshold, even

if most usage occurs in that direction. If the TDD downlink duty cycle is 0.75, the

threshold is 100% in direction 8, and the thresholds in other directions are all

25%, then even with 50% usage in direction 8, as shown in Figure 4, the time-averaged and normalized

EIRP is below the threshold in direction 8. Therefore, the power control is not

triggered.

Comparing

the Counters of the EMF Power Lock Mid-Band and the NR Directional Control for EMF

Power Lock Mid-Band Features

The EMF Power Lock Mid-Band and the NR Directional Control for EMF Power Lock

Mid-Band features have several counters that show the same information for both

features. These counters are listed in Table 1.

# 4 Network Impact of EMF Power Lock Mid-Band

This feature interacts with the downlink scheduler to dynamically reduce the

momentary output power when it is needed. Throughput might be reduced, but coverage is not

affected.

Capacity and Performance

As the dynamic limit for the maximum number of scheduled PRBs is updated at every

control step, throughput can be reduced in high load scenarios if the output power

is reduced by this feature. Impact on the following is minimized due to the constant

re-evaluation of the dynamic limit:

- Capacity
- Cell performance
- Throughput

This mechanism of limiting the output power does not affect coverage.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band

The EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature introduces parameters for dynamically updating

the output power. Output power limitation results in keeping the average power of the radio

node below the configured threshold.

# 7 Activate EMF Power Lock Mid-Band

This is a basic feature. It does not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated, but the feature needs to be enabled and configured manually.

While optional features need to be activated, basic features are activated

automatically during node integration. They also do not have a software license key

associated, which means that they have no entries in the LKF that is installed on

the node. The feature needs to be enabled by creating a

PowerBackoff MO instance and configuring its attributes.

Prerequisites

- The SectorEquipmentFunction.operationalState attribute, which is referenced from the NRSectorCarrier MO, is set to ENABLED.
- The SectorEquipmentFunction.availabilityStatus attribute, which is referenced from the NRSectorCarrier MO, is empty.

Steps

1. Set the NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
2. Create a PowerBackoff MO instance under the desired NRSectorCarrier MO instance. Note: The PowerBackoff MO attributes are restricted. This means that they can only be set when the MO instance is created. To change them, the MO instance must be deleted and recreated. This is done to limit the risk of accidental changes of the attributes that could cause the violation of the EMF regulations. None of the attribute changes take effect until the next sector carrier unlock.
3. Set the PowerBackoff.powerBackoffEnabled attribute to true.
4. Set the PowerBackoff.powerBackoffAvgTime to the desired value.
5. Set the PowerBackoff.powerBackoffThresh to the desired value.
6. Set the NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for EMF Power Lock Mid-Band

All attributes of the EMF Power Lock Mid-Band feature have to be configured according

to the local EMF regulatory requirements. The averaging time can change

depending on the frequency band. The EMF level can also vary based on local

regulations.
