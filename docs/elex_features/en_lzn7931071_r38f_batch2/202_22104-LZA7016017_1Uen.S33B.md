# 1 NR Micro Sleep Rx Overview

NR Micro Sleep Rx is an energy efficiency feature. It saves energy by automatically

enabling sleep mode on the RX components for each sector when there is no uplink

traffic.

| Feature Name           | NR Micro Sleep Rx                                       |

Summary

The NR Micro Sleep Rx feature decreases the energy consumption of radio units. Power

consumption is reduced by automatically switching off the low-noise amplifiers for

empty symbols when no user data is transmitted in the uplink.

This feature has the following benefits:

- Reduced power consumption when traffic is low by enabling DTX in uplink
- Reduced power consumption for OFDM symbols that are not used for the transmission of user data

The SRS NR uplink transmission format is kept intact.

NR Micro Sleep Rx automatically enables and disables the low-noise amplifier in the radio. The

low-noise amplifier is turned off in the following cases:

- No PUSCH traffic is scheduled on a subframe.
- No PUSCH traffic is scheduled during symbols that do not carry mandatory information.

NR Micro Sleep Rx is a non-license-controlled feature. Once it is activated, it

cannot be deactivated.

# 2 Dependencies of NR Micro Sleep Rx

This feature has a conflicting dependency with the Uplink Spectrum Analyzer

feature.

Hardware

This feature is applicable to the following radio units:

- AIR 1672
- AIR 3255
- AIR 3283
- AIR 6428
- AIR 6472

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Micro Sleep Rx

The NR Micro Sleep Rx feature turns off the low-noise amplifier when no data is

transmitted in uplink.

The radio unit reduces energy consumption by turning off the low-noise amplifier when no

data is transmitted in uplink. The functionality runs on an RF-port basis in each

supported radio type and configuration.

The feature enables and disables the main low-noise amplifier of the radio by turning the

gate bias on and off based on a symbol-duration timescale. The low-noise amplifier is

turned off for each symbol when no data is transmitted in uplink. In each case, the

Baseband unit indicates if the radio can turn off the low-noise amplifier.

To turn off low-noise amplifiers, the following conditions must apply:

- No data is transmitted on any of the carriers that use the same RF port.
- The Single Mode Multiple Carriers configuration is used.

If data is transmitted on at least one carrier, the low-noise amplifiers of the

corresponding RF port are turned on.

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

Energy consumption can be monitored through the following PM counters:

- EnergyMeter.pmConsumedEnergy
- EnergyMeter.pmConsumedEnergyAccumulated
- EnergyMeter.pmMaxPowerConsumption
- EnergyMeter.pmMinPowerConsumption
- EnergyMeter.pmPowerConsumption
- EnergyMeter.pmVoltage

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
