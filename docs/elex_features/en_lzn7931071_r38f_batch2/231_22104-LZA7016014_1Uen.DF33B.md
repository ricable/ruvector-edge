Energy metering is supported on the following support system units:

- PDU 03 02, PDU 03 01
- PSU AC 03
- EMU

Energy metering is not supported on the following support system units:

- BFU 01 02, BFU 01 03
- PDU 01 01, PDU 01 03, PDU 01 04, PDU 02 01, PDU 02 02
- PSU AC 01
- SAU 01 01, SAU 02 01
- SCU 01 01, SCU 02 01, SCU 03 01

The accuracy of the energy metering is ±5% for Ericsson radio units released before

24.Q1. For Ericsson radio units released in or after 24.Q1, the accuracy is ±3%.

Limitations

- The PM counters under the EnergyMeter MO for RBS 6501 show the consumption of the integrated radio unit, not the whole RBS. To see the consumption of the whole RBS 6501, legacy counters under the MO EnergyMeasurement must be used instead.
- The measurement of the power consumption of the radio unit includes the power consumption of RET and TMA equipment with power supply from a radio unit.
- The EnergyMeter.pmVoltage PM counter reports only in absolute values.
- The EnergyMeter.pmVoltage PM counter is not supported on the following units: Radio Processor 6337 Radio Processor 6507 Streetmacro 6705
- If the number of active EnergyMeter MOs reaches a limit that the system can handle, new instances are not automatically enabled. The new instances are created with the EnergyMeter.operationalState attribute set to DISABLED, and the EnergyMeter.availabilityStatus attribute set to OFF\_LINE. The operator can use the setEnergyMeterEnabledMO action to manually reallocate the active instances.
- For any consumer units that do not support energy measurement reporting, the EnergyMeter MO is not created.
- When the node is restarted or upgraded, all of the DISABLED EnergyMeter MO instances, where the EnergyMeter.availabilityStatus attribute is set to NOT\_INSTALLED, are deleted.
- All PM counters under the EnergyMeter MO, except the EnergyMeter.pmConsumedEnergyAccumulated PM counter are suspect marked if either of the following conditions are true: The measuring hardware unit is disconnected. The measuring hardware unit does not provide measurements for the duration of the Recording Output Period (ROP).

Network Requirements

There are no network requirements for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Energy Metering

The Energy Metering feature provides a standardized way to observe power consumption

and energy consumption of radio units and installed support systems.

Measurements are presented with PM counters under the following MOs:

- EnergyMeter
- ConsumedEnergyMeasurement
- ConsumedEnergy for DUWs only
- EnergyMeasurement

The PM counters are activated automatically, except those that are under the

EnergyMeasurement MO, where manual configuration is needed.

Measurements provided by the PM counters under the EnergyMeasurement

are only possible on the primary node.

EnergyMeter MO

The EnergyMeter MO is automatically created and enabled for each

supported radio unit and installed support system units of the node.

The PM counters under the EnergyMeter MO measure the following

characteristics:

- Energy consumption
- Accumulated energy consumption
- Average power consumption
- Average voltage

The energy measurements using the EnergyMeter MO are supported by

the following hardware:

- Baseband units
- EMU
- HE-PSU
- Modular PDU System
- Radio Gateway
- Radio Processor
- RAN Processor
- Streetmacro

The PM counters under the EnergyMeter MO in the Baseband Radio Node

support measurements on the following units:

Table 2   Supported Units and parent MOs of the EnergyMeter

| Supported Baseband units                                | FieldReplaceableUnit       |
| Supported radio units                                   | FieldReplaceableUnit       |
| PSU AC 03                                               | FieldReplaceableUnit       |
| EMU                                                     | FieldReplaceableUnit       |
| Modular PDU System                                      | FieldReplaceableUnit       |
| Each individual output (e-fuse) on a Modular PDU System | EFuse                      |

The PM counters of the EnergyMeter MO in the modular PDU system

controller are used to measure the following characteristics:

- System voltage, measured by the EnergyMeter.pmVoltage PM counter.
- Total energy consumption of the modular PDU system
- Average power consumption of all ECMs on a PDU subrack or cassette

The EnergyMeter MO can be manually enabled or disabled with the

EnergyMeter.setEnergyMeterEnabled action, for example, if the

maximum number of active EnergyMeter MOs is reached.

ConsumedEnergyMeasurement and

ConsumedEnergy MOs

The ConsumedEnergyMeasurement and

ConsumedEnergy MOs automatically show the total consumption

from all units of the node that have an EnergyMeter MO and

support energy measurements. Field replaceable units contributing to measurements

presented by the EnergyMeasurement are excluded from these

measurements.

Energy measurements presented by the ConsumedEnergy MO are

supported on DUWs, while the energy measurements presented by the

ConsumedEnergyMeasurement are supported on the following

units:

- Baseband units
- Radio Gateway
- Radio Processor
- Radio units
- RAN Processor
- Streetmacro

The ConsumedEnergyMeasurement and the

ConsumedEnergy MOs are created automatically.

The EnergyMeasurement MO can be configured to summarize the power

consumption of active EnergyMeter MOs for support system units

representing PSUs, EMUs or PDUs, that is, e-fuses. Each e-fuse measures the

following characteristics:

- Output voltage
- Output current
- Output power
- Energy consumption

The PM counters under the ConsumedEnergyMeasurement MO and the

ConsumedEnergy MO are used to measure the following for the

whole node, based on values reported from radio units that support energy

measurements:

- Energy consumption
- Accumulated energy consumption
- Average power consumption

The following attributes can be used to get a ratio of units supporting power

measurements and the total number of radio units in the node.

- ConsumedEnergyMeasurement.noOfContributingUnits
- ConsumedEnergy.noOfContributingUnits
- ConsumedEnergyMeasurement.totalNoOfUnits
- ConsumedEnergy.totalNoOfUnits

EnergyMeasurment MO

This MO displays energy consumption in the node or part of the node.

The PM counters under this MO are only applicable to the following support

systems:

- PSU
- EMU
- PDU of the ECM type

In one cabinet, PM counters under the

EnergyMeasurement MO from multiple support system units of the

same type, such as PDUs, EMUs, or PSUs, can be used. However, the combination of

different types of units cannot be used.

Several EnergyMeasurment MO instances can be created to summarize

the power consumption of different parts of a Modular PDU System.

Momentary values of these measurements can be read from corresponding attributes on

the EnergyMeter MO. Measurement values can be also read directly

from related PM counters.

Additionally, PM counters of the EnergyMeter MO representing PDU

Controllers are used to measure the following characteristics from all ECMs on a

subrack or cassette:

- System voltage
- Total energy consumption
- Average power consumption

Different attributes are supported on the EnergyMeter MO if e-fuse

or PDU Controller is present.

Measurements on individual radio units are not synchronized. The measurement results

are shown only if the radio unit supports the relevant measurements.

The EnergyMeasurement.pmAccumulatedEnergyConsumption PM counter is

suspect marked in the following cases:

- It is not started (startTime not reached).
- It is stopped (stopTime reached).

Other conditions that have impact on the reported energy measurement values (PM

counters are evaluated but their values can be lower or higher than expected):

- The system is running on batteries. This situation causes an alarm.
- The system is charging batteries. This situation occurs because of the following reasons: Prior Power Loss and Running On Battery Supply alarms Equalized charging, which can be operator initiated or time scheduled Battery test, which can be operator initiated or time scheduled Battery charge or discharge because of some other reasons, like battery temperature fluctuations

The values of the EnergyMeasurement.operationalState and the

EnergyMeasurement.availabilityStatus attributes depend on

different events.

The PM counters under EnergyMeasurement MO are used to measure the

total energy consumption of one of the following units:

- An RBS cabinet
- A selected number of consumer units that are supplied with power by the Modular PDU System or the EMU

The EnergyMeasurement.energyMeterListRef parameter must be

manually configured to obtain measurements.

The consumed energy is measured on the following units:

- Power providers, such as the PSU
- Power distributors, such as the Modular PDU System
- Clamp-on energy meters, such as the EMU

## 3.1 Overview of Energy Consumption Measurement Aggregation

On a site with Ericsson power system, energy consumption can be measured on the following

levels:

- Site level - AC-fed cabinet The incoming AC voltage energy consumption in a cabinet can be measured by aggregating the energy meters from the installed PSUs. The units to be included in the measurement are configured in the EnergyMeasurement MO.
- Site level - DC-fed cabinet The DC voltage energy consumption can be aggregated for several PDUs including all e-fuses, selected e-fuses, or EMUs. The units to be included in the measurement are configured in one or several EnergyMeasurement MOs.
- Equipment level - consumer units The energy consumption of Baseband units and radio units that support the EnergyMeter MO is automatically aggregated by the ConsumedEnergyMeasurement MO (for Baseband units).

Figure 2 shows an example of energy consumption

measurement aggregation on site. The energy consumption of the units not supporting

energy metering is calculated by the PDU (e-fuse).

Figure 2   Example for Energy Consumption Measurement Aggregation

In one cabinet, PM counters under the

EnergyMeasurement MO from multiple support system units of the

same type, such as PDUs, EMUs, or PSUs, can be used. However, the combination of

different types of units cannot be used.

## 3.3 Perform Energy Measurements Using the EnergyMeasurement MO

Steps

1. Configure and connect all PSUs, EMUs, or PDUs available in the system.
2. Create and activate PmJob MO instances to activate PM counters. For more information on how to activate the related PM counters, see Manage Performance.
3. Start the energy measurement by creating the EnergyMeasurement MO. Time period settings Action Set length Define the beginning and the end of the measurement period by configuring the values of the EnergyMeasurement.startTime and EnergyMeasurement.stopTime attributes. PM counter EnergyMeasurement.pmAccumulatedEnergyConsumption only reports the accumulated energy consumption within this time period. Undefined No further action is needed. The system starts the energy measurements at the creation of the MO.
4. Add the units to be included in the energy measurement by setting the EnergyMeasurement.energyMeterListRef attribute to the LDN of the unit.

If several measurements are performed, do the following:

5. Repeat Step 3 with the appropriate instruction.

If the time period is not set, do the following:

6. Stop the energy measurement by deleting the EnergyMeasurement MOs.

## 3.4 Perform Energy Measurements Using the EnergyMeter MO

Steps

1. Configure and connect all PSUs, EMUs, or PDUs available in the system.
2. Create and activate PmJob MO instances to activate PM counters. For more information on how to activate the related PM counters, see Manage Performance.

Results

Configuration of energy measurements using the EnergyMeter MO is

done by the system. The PM counters provide energy measurements about the board or a

part of a node. It is possible to have more measurement points, and their

consumption values can be different. An EnergyMeter MO that is on

a PDU or an e-fuse visualizes the distribution of power and energy consumption in

the node. The EnergyMeter.availabilityStatus and the

EnergyMeter.operationalState are the two attributes on the

EnergyMeter

MO. Measurements start

automatically after creating a PmJob MO.

## 3.5 Configure Low DC Input Voltage Notification

The low DC input voltage notification enables the detection of external power issues

before a node shutdown occurs. The Input Voltage Below Configured

Threshold alarm is raised by the system if the DC input voltage

level decreases below the configured value for a FRU for a configured duration. The

alarm is intended for power systems where a backup battery supplies power to the

FRU. The notification must be configured manually.

Prerequisites

- To enable the notification, the EnergyMeter.operationalState attribute must be set to ENABLED.
- The notification must be supported on the FRU.

Steps

1. Define the criteria to raise the Input Voltage Below Configured Threshold alarm by specifying the values of the following EnergyMeter.lowDcInputVoltageNotification struct members: perceviedSeverity alarmRaiseVoltage alarmCeaseVoltage alarmRaiseDelay alarmCeaseDelay The value of alarmCeaseVoltage must be set higher than the value of alarmRaiseVoltage. If alarmRaiseVoltage is set to -1, the notification is disabled. Note: If the struct members are configured incorrectly, too many or no alarms are raised. The notification must be configured according to the behavior of the power system and its backup system.
2. Execute the EnergyMeter.configureLowDcInputVoltageNotification action with the specified EnergyMeter.lowDcInputVoltageNotification struct members.
3. Verify that the notification is enabled by checking the EnergyMeter.lowDcInputVoltageNotification attribute and its status struct member. The status struct member shows one of the following notification statuses: ENABLED The notification is enabled. The Input Voltage Below Configured Threshold alarm is raised when the configured criteria are fulfilled. DISABLED The notification is disabled. The Input Voltage Below Configured Threshold alarm is not raised. NOT\_SUPPORTED The notification is not supported on the FRU. The Input Voltage Below Configured Threshold alarm is not raised.

Results

The low DC input voltage notification is configured.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
