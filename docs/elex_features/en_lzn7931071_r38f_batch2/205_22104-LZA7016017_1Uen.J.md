# 1 NR Traffic Offload Overview

This feature improves the accessibility of selected UEs when an NR cell is congested.

UEs are moved to an LTE cell if traffic in the NR cell is above the configured

threshold.

Summary

This feature introduces the Offload-Triggered Inter-System Handover functionality to improve

the accessibility of selected UEs. UEs are moved to an LTE cell if the traffic level

in the NR cell is above the configured threshold. This way, if a cell is congested

because the maximum number of connected UEs is reached, the defined UEs can be moved

to a nearby eNodeB. The UEs to be moved are selected using the UE grouping

framework.

Hardware

No impact.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The N26 interface must be deployed between the MME and the AMF, otherwise the IRAT

inter-system handover fails.

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Traffic Offload

This feature introduces the Offload-Triggered Inter-System Handover functionality to

improve the accessibility of selected UEs.

Operational Process

The NR Traffic Offload feature moves the UEs to an LTE cell if the traffic level in

the NR cell is above the configured threshold. This way, if a cell is congested

because the maximum number of connected UEs is reached, the defined UEs can be moved

to a nearby eNodeB. The UEs to be moved are selected using the UE grouping

framework.

The criteria for Offload-Triggered Inter-System Handover are evaluated for the UE in

the following cases:

- Incoming handover
- Initial Context Setup
- RRC Reestablishment
- RRC Resume

## 3.1 Supported Trigger Quantities for B1 Measurements

RSRP, RSRQ, or SINR can be configured as the

trigger quantity for the B1 measurements used by the feature.

The B1 measurements used by this feature can be based on one of the following trigger

quantities:

- RSRP
- RSRQ
- SINR Note: The ss-SINR-Meas capability is used by UEs that support SSB-based SINR measurements on NR frequencies.

The OffloadCellProfileUeCfg.pCellCandidateTriggerQuantity

attribute defines the trigger quantity used for B1 measurements.

Table 2   Possible Trigger Quantities for B1 Measurements

| Value              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| RSRQ               | RSRQ is used as the trigger quantity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| SINR_FALLBACK_RSRP | If the UE supports SINR measurements on NR frequencies, SINR                                         is used as the trigger quantity.  If the UE does not support SINR measurements for NR                                         frequencies, the function falls back to use RSRP as the                                         trigger quantity. |
| SINR_FALLBACK_RSRQ | If the UE supports SINR measurements on NR frequencies, SINR                                         is used as the trigger quantity.

The B1 measurements for PCell candidates can be configured for the selected trigger

quantity through the following attributes:

- OffloadCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB1
- OffloadCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB1
- OffloadCellProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB1

The frequency relation threshold offset for the B1 measurements can be configured for

each trigger quantity through the following attributes:

- OffloadEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB1Offset
- OffloadEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB1Offset
- OffloadEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB1Offset

## 3.2 Additional Target Evaluation of Reported Quantities for B1 Measurements

The gNodeB can be configured to evaluate reported quantities other than the

trigger quantity that are included in the B1 measurement report for the

PCell.

The gNodeB can be configured to evaluate a reported quantity included in

the

B1 measurement report other than the selected trigger quantity

for that measurement. The additional evaluation ensures that the evaluated quantity

is not poor in the target cell.

The attribute used to define the additional reported quantity to be evaluated depends

on the trigger quantity defined for the

measurements.

The reported value of the configured additional quantity included in the measurement

report is evaluated against a threshold. The threshold corresponds to the value

required to trigger B1 measurements if the reported quantity is used as the trigger

quantity. If the value of the reported quantity is lower than or equal to the

threshold value, the reported cell is treated as a cell out of coverage. If the

value of the reported quantity is higher than the threshold value, the reported cell

is considered to be good enough to be a handover target.

For B1 measurements using RSRP as the trigger quantity, the threshold is calculated

through the following method:

1. The following values are summed up: The value of the threshold struct member in the OffloadCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB1 attribute The value of the hysteresis struct member in the OffloadCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB1 attribute The value of the OffloadEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB1Offset attribute
2. The value of the EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffset attribute is subtracted.

For B1 measurements using RSRQ as the trigger quantity, the threshold is calculated

by summing up the following values:

- The value of the threshold struct member in the OffloadCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB1 attribute
- The value of the hysteresis struct member in the OffloadCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB1 attribute
- The value of the OffloadEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB1Offset attribute

For B1 measurements using SINR as the trigger quantity, the threshold is calculated

by summing up the following values:

- The value of the threshold struct member in the OffloadCellProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB1 attribute
- The value of the hysteresis struct member in the OffloadCellProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB1 attribute
- The value of the OffloadEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB1Offset attribute

## 3.3 UE Group Support for Offload-Triggered Inter-System Handover

The Offload-Triggered Inter-System Handover function is adapted to the UE Grouping

Framework

feature.

The following configuration attributes, which are used by the Offload-Triggered

Inter-System Handover

functionality,

belong to MO classes that are adapted to the UE Grouping

Framework

feature:

- OffloadCellProfileUeCfg.offloadISHoEnabled
- OffloadCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB1
- OffloadCellProfileUeCfg.ueOffloadISHoRatio
- OffloadEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB1Offset
- UeMCEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.connModeAllowedPCell

The attributes are read from MO instances that are selected based on the UE groups that

the UE belongs to.

Because of UE group differentiation, these attributes must be considered when creating

multiple instances of these MO classes.

When the UE groups that the UE belongs to change, the change can result in the selection

of a new instance of one or several MO classes to which the listed attributes belong. If

B1 measurements are ongoing in the UE and the value of any of the listed attributes

changes because of the selection of a new MO instance, the B1 measurements are

reconfigured in the UE with the new values. If the Offload-Triggered Inter-System

Handover function is enabled and no ongoing B1 measurements

exist,

a B1 measurement is configured in the UE after a UE group change.

The UE group support for this function is controlled by the User- and Service-Specific

Mobility feature. If the license of this feature is not activated, configuration data is

always taken from the

Base

instances of the following MO classes:

- OffloadCellProfileUeCfg
- OffloadEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg
- UeMCEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg

For more information on the feature license activation, see User- and Service-Specific Mobility.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Traffic Offload

Control channel signaling between the node and the UE can increase.

Capacity and Performance

The feature uses event measurements that

can

increase control channel signaling between the node and the UE.

The number of handover attempts

can

increase.

Interfaces

The number of RRC measurement reports might increase if

additional target evaluation is enabled for measurement reports for traffic offload.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Traffic Offload

Several attributes are introduced to configure this

feature.

The feature is also affected by attributes that control the offloading functionality of

other features.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.b: 24.Q4.0: Downlink Quality Metric Enhancements for Traffic Offload Features

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces the use of RSRQ or SINR as

a

trigger quantity for A5 and B1 measurements used by the

Prohibited

Cell-Triggered Mobility function of

the NR Mobility feature, and the following traffic offload features:

- NR Booster Carrier Sleep
- NR Cell Soft Lock
- NR Traffic Offload

This feature enhancement

enables

performing an additional evaluation of

a reported candidate PCell

through

checking a reported quantity other than the trigger quantity. The additional

evaluation is performed when measurement reports are received for A5 and B1 traffic

offload measurements.

Capacity and

Performance

The number of RRC measurements can increase if the additional target evaluation is

enabled for traffic offload measurement reports.

This feature enhancement might

improve

the following

KPIs:

- NR Handover Execution success rate captured in source gNodeB
- NR-to-LTE Inter-RAT Handover Execution success rate captured in source gNodeB

For more information on KPIs, see Key Performance Indicators.
