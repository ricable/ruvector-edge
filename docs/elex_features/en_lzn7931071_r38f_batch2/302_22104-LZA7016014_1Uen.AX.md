Summary

The CMPv2 feature is used for the enrollment and renewal of certificates. The renewal

of certificates can be timer-based updates or updates initiated by the user. CMPv2

is 3GPP compliant and can use vendor credentials for authentication of the node.

Additional Information

For more information about this feature and related topics, see 3GPP TS

33.310 and Manage Security.

# 6 Performance of CMPv2

The feature has no associated KPIs, counters, or events.

Key Performance Indicators

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
