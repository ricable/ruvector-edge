# 1 NR Soft Upgrade Overview

This feature integrates the NR Cell Soft Lock feature with software upgrade use cases to

avoid the need for manual operations.

Summary

To minimize the end user impact because of maintenance actions, this feature gradually

offloads NR traffic from sites that are about to upgrade and restart.

This feature has the following benefits:

- Offloading the NR traffic to neighboring sites in the coverage range reduces the number of call drops during software upgrade.
- The number of subscribers in the network remains on a constant level during the upgrade of the site.
- Integrating the NR Cell Soft Lock feature in the upgrade flow eliminates the need for manual operations.

| NR Cell Soft Lock | FAJ 121 5575       | NR            | Prerequisite   | Node-level prerequisite | The NR Cell Soft Lock feature must be activated for the NR Soft                                     Upgrade feature to be operational. The feature aims to redirect                                     traffic to another cell, which is required for the NR Soft                                     Upgrade feature. |

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Soft Upgrade

The feature introduces a soft upgrade procedure for Baseband Radio Nodes.

The feature

performs soft upgrade according to the following process:

1. The operator initiates soft upgrade by setting the upgradeType parameter to the SOFT value in the UpgradePackage.activate MO action. The soft upgrade can be performed from ENM within Automated Software Upgrade (ASU) or Software Hardware Manager (SHM) on the group of nodes.
2. The existing configurations of the NR Cell Soft Lock feature are reused except for the NRCellDU.maxOffloadDurationShutDown attribute. The value of the NRCellDU.maxOffloadDurationShutDown attribute is limited to 500 seconds during the upgrade if its current value exceeds 500 seconds or if it is set to -1. The initial value of the NRCellDU.maxOffloadDurationShutDown attribute is preserved and restored after the upgrade.
3. The NR Cell Soft Lock feature is triggered for the maximum duration controlled by the NRCellDU.maxOffloadDurationShutDown attribute. For detailed information about NR cell soft lock, see NR Cell Soft Lock.
4. The system proceeds with the upgrade and reboot.
5. The traffic is restored immediately after the reboot.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Soft Upgrade

# 6 Performance of NR Soft Upgrade

The feature has no related KPIs, counters, or events.

Key Performance Indicators

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
