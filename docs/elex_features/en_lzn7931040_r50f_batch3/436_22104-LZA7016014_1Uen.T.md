Summary

The ASGH QCI Range Extension feature enhances the ASGH Framework in the following

ways:

- The QCI range is extended for UE selection in the ASGH Framework, making UE selection more flexible.
- The AND logical connection is supported between two QCIs in the ASGH selection criteria during the UE selection in the ASGH framework.
- New flexible counters are introduced in both uplink and downlink by introducing support for flexible counters for measuring PRB use.

parameter.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter                                | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SubscriberGroupProfile.customTriggerType | Affected | The customTriggerList[1] is the first element in                                     SubscriberGroupProfile.customTriggerList that                                 is used as an additional QCI condition to evaluate UE bearers.  This parameter is evaluated as true or false based on the                                 operator-defined value range of CustomTriggerList[1].   If the operator-defined value of CustomTriggerList[1] is in the                                 valid range between 1 to 255, the trigger evaluate to true or false                                 according to UE’s QCI, otherwise always evaluate to true. |

# 6 Performance of ASGH QCI Range Extension

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators and introduces two new

counters to measure performance of functionalities on ASGH

Framework.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators.

Counters

- pmFlexPrbUsedDlDtch
- pmFlexPrbUsedUlDtch

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
