# 1 ASGH Framework Overview

The feature

provides a framework that enables the classification of subscribers into ASGs. This way,

different system configurations can be applied to the different

ASGs.

Summary

An

ASG

is a subset of all RRC

connected

users in a node that

fulfill

the triggering and selection criteria

defined

in

a specific

ASG

profile.

This is done to classify the subscribers and

to

specify attributes to differentiate between system

configurations.

Higher benchmark performance can be achieved with

the

ASGH

Framework

feature and other ASGH-based

features.

The

service

specific

BLER

target

enhancement

increases

the

flexibility of BLER target configuration for this

feature,

reducing packet loss rate during both

uplink

and

downlink.

This is an optional enhancement activated by

the

EUtranCellFDD.blerTargetConfigEnabled and the

EUtranCellTDD.blerTargetConfigEnabled

attributes.

# 2 Dependencies of ASGH Framework

This feature is a prerequisite for ASGH-related features. In addition, the feature

enhances the function of other features by introducing ASGs.

# 3 Feature Operation of ASGH Framework

The feature groups UEs into ASGs based on the trigger conditions defined for each ASG profile. Then, QCI modification parameters are configured.

Process Steps

1. Grouping UEs The UEs are selected in a subscriber group when all the following trigger conditions are true: SubscriberGroupProfile.bearerTriggerList SubscriberGroupProfile.cellTriggerList SubscriberGroupProfile.customTriggerList SubscriberGroupProfile.spidTriggerList Each trigger list is evaluated independently every time the bearer of a subscriber is set up, modified, or released. Each element within a trigger list is matched irrespective of the other elements of the same list. If a subscriber matches at least one element in a trigger list, it is considered to match the whole list. An empty list matches all the subscribers. A subscriber is only selected as a member of the ASG if the subscriber matches all the lists. The AND logical connection is used to set up this trigger condition. If a subscriber fulfills more than one SubscriberGroupProfile MO, only the SubscriberGroupProfile MO with the highest priority applies. The feature supports up to ten subscriber profiles. Setting all trigger lists of an ASG to empty has the following consequences: Setting all trigger lists for a subscriber group to empty is not recommended unless it is necessary, for example in test cases. Even then, the subscriber group with empty trigger lists must be set to a low priority. It is recommended to set low priority to a subscriber group that have empty SPID trigger lists. If such subscriber group has higher priority than a subscriber group with a SubscriberGroupProfile.spidTriggerList attribute with a value of 0 or other, all UEs are matched regardless of the UEs having SPID. Note: Category M1 and NB-IoT devices are excluded from ASGs.
    - All subscribers are selected for the ASG with empty trigger lists if no other ASGs are configured with higher priority.
    - A group of subscribers is selected for an ASG with some of the trigger lists specified if the following conditions are fulfilled: The subscribers match the trigger lists of the ASG. The ASG has higher priority than the ASG with empty trigger lists. For the subscribers selected for such ASG with some of the trigger lists specified, the ASG with empty trigger lists is ignored.
2. Configuration of QCI modification parameters Each ASG profile includes four bearers to map the standardized QCI 6, QCI 7, QCI 8, and QCI 9 into the range of operator-defined QCIs. If the Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk feature is activated, QCI 65, QCI 66, QCI 69, and QCI 70 are considered when the QCIs are remapped. If the remapped QCI results in a PTT QCI, the original QCI profile is applied.

## 3.1 Service Specific BLER Target

The service

specific

BLER

target

enhancement

increases

the flexibility of BLER target configuration by categorizing UEs with

different types of services into corresponding

ASGs.

If service specific BLER target is enabled, the BLER target can be configured for each

ASG separately. Service specific BLER target is deactivated by default and the legacy

BLER target values are used for all ASGs. If both the legacy downlink or uplink BLER

target and the service specific BLER target are enabled simultaneously, the service

specific BLER target has higher priority.

If the Carrier Aggregation feature is used with the ASGH Framework feature, the service

specific BLER target configuration is used for PCells, SCells, and ESCells.

## 3.2 Improved Voice Reliability with Optimized MCS

VoLTE quality can be improved by optimizing the upper and lower MCS limits.

It is recommended to configure all VoLTE UEs into one subscriber group and optimize that

subscriber group with the upper and lower MCS limits for improved VoLTE quality.

## 3.3 Dynamic BLER Target

The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature introduces a machine learning algorithm

that adjusts the downlink BLER target for each UE in an ASG according to the inter-cell

interference situation.

The aim of the machine learning algorithm is to increase the

performance of the existing downlink link

adaptation.

There are machine learning algorithm models available depending on the value of the

SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetAlg attribute. The models

available are the following:

- Model 0, if the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetAlg attribute is set to 0. This model optimizes more link adaptation parameters than Model 1, and improves the convergence of the downlink link adaptation algorithm for both heavy and light UE sessions.
- Model 1, if the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetAlg attribute is set to 1. This model is well tested in the field and improves the convergence of the downlink link adaptation algorithm for heavy UE sessions. Note: Model 1 is available for cases which might require backward compatibility.

The algorithm periodically adjusts the downlink Block Error

Rate (BLER) target to maximize spectral efficiency. This is done according to the

current inter-cell interference situation for each UE in the ASGs. The algorithm is

trained to determine the BLER target based on the interference statistics of the tracked

neighbor cells.

The machine learning algorithm sets the BLER target for the

UEs based on the history of the neighbor cell traffic activity and UE signal quality.

Each cell with dynamic BLER target keeps a periodically updated list of the tracked

neighbor cells and subscribes to periodic PRB use reports from those cells. The tracked

neighbor cells are sorted in the list based on interference strength.

Dynamic BLER target replaces the static BLER target of 10%.

Depending on the interference conditions, the chosen dynamic BLER target can be higher

or lower than 10%. In most cases, this also results in a higher or lower MCS selected

for transmission. A high BLER and high MCS can be beneficial in case of large and

unpredictable channel quality variations. Such variations are associated with inter-cell

interference scenarios with bursty traffic. Consequently, the average downlink HARQ BLER

can increase if this feature is activated.

The dynamic BLER target range is configured manually for each ASG. The tracked neighbor

cell list can be configured either manually or automatically by the automatic neighbor

cell ranking algorithm.

## 3.4 Subscriber Profile-Based EN-DC Configuration

EN-DC configuration can be applied on a SPID basis.

### 3.4.1 Mapping of Advanced Subscriber Groups and EN-DC User Profiles

The EndcUserProfile MO is used to aggregate the EN-DC user parameters

to map to different advanced subscriber groups. To use the

EndcUserProfile MO, the association between the

EndcUserProfile and the SubscriberGroupProfile

MOs is defined with the SubscriberGroupProfile.endcUserProfileRef

attribute. Because of this, a subscriber group classified by the ASGH Framework might

refer the parameters defined within the EndcUserProfile MO.

The classification of a group of devices with SPID value is based on the ASGH Framework.

The ASGH policy does not allow the UE to belong to multiple user groups. When the UE

meets the criteria of several groups, the most prioritized one is chosen. Because of

this, the groups must be configured carefully.

### 3.4.2 Subscriber Profile-Based EN-DC Control

The SPID-based EN-DC is allowed if the ENodeBFunction.endcAllowed

attribute is set to false, and the

EndcUserProfile.endcAllowedOverride attribute is set to

true. In this case, EN-DC is allowed for UEs with matching

### 3.4.3 Subscriber Profile-Based B1 Measurement Threshold Configuration for EN-DC

The B1 measurement threshold can be configured on a subscriber profile basis for an

EN-DC-capable UE. To configure the B1 measurement on a subscriber profile basis, the

SubscriberGroupProfile.endcUserProfileRef attribute must refer to

an instance of the EndcUserProfile MO with subscriber

profile-specific configuration.

When B1 measurement is configured, the eNodeB checks if the UE is defined in the ASGH

framework. If the UE is defined in the ASGH framework, the eNodeB checks if the

following attributes have a non-default value:

- EndcUserProfile.b1ThresholdRsrpOverride
- EndcUserProfile.b1ThresholdRsrqOverride
- EndcUserProfile.hysteresisB1Override
- EndcUserProfile.timeToTriggerB1Override

### 3.4.4 Subscriber Profile-Based B1 Measurement Gap Configuration in EN-DC

The EndcUserProfile.endcB1MeasGapConfigOverride attribute can be used

to control whether a B1 measurement gap is configured for EN-DC-capable

UEs in a subscriber group. It is possible to control B1 measurement

gaps separately for Low-Band and Mid-Band frequencies and for High-Band frequencies.

### 3.4.5 Subscriber Profile-Based B1 Measurement Timer Configuration for EN-DC

The values of the following attributes can be overridden for ASGs using the corresponding

attributes of the EndcUserProfile MO class:

- The UeMeasControl.endcMeasRestartTime parameter can be overridden with the EndcUserProfile.endcMeasRestartTimeOverride parameter.
- The UeMeasControl.endcMeasTime parameter can be overridden with the EndcUserProfile.endcMeasTimeOverride parameter.

The ASG group that is assigned for the UE, can be changed during the session. To prevent

the changing of the parameters, the values of the following attributes are saved at a

new connection, and used throughout the session:

- UeMeasControl.endcMeasRestartTime
- UeMeasControl.endcMeasTime

When configuring a group, attributes do not overlap. Because of this, a new group might

need to be defined for B1 measurement timers. In this case, the parameters of the other

groups cannot be applied.

To provide the best EN-DC connectivity for users with FWA, it is recommended to set the

attributes one of the following ways:

- The value of the EndcUserProfile.endcMeasTimeOverride attribute is set to -1.
- The value of the EndcUserProfile.endcMeasTimeOverride attribute is set to 2000, and the value of the EndcUserProfile.endcMeasRestartTimeOverride attribute is set to 0.

### 3.4.6 Subscriber Profile-Based EN-DC Setup Inhibition Timer

The EN-DC setup inhibition timer is

used

to set a period when EN-DC setup is inhibited after the release of an

E-RAB used for VoLTE.

When the EN-DC setup inhibition timer

is running, the UE can start another VoLTE call without the EN-DC setup procedure

interfering. Also, the UE is not configured with the B1 measurement during the RRC

Connection Reconfiguration procedure.

When the EN-DC setup inhibition timer expires, the UE can be configured with the B1

measurement and downlink, uplink, or dowlink and uplink buffer monitoring is

started.

The EN-DC setup inhibition timer can be configured on ASG level with

the EndcUserProfile.endcInhibitTimeOverride attribute.

The value of the UeMeasControl.endcInhibitTime attribute can be

overridden for ASGs using the EndcUserProfile.endcInhibitTimeOverride

attribute.

The value of the UeMeasControl.endcInhibitTime attribute or its

overridden value is saved at a new connection and used throughout the session. This

prevents the changing of the attribute value even if the ASG assigned to the UE is

changed during the session.

### 3.4.7 Subscriber Profile-Based Frequency Differentiation of Time to Trigger Configuration for the B1 Measurement

For UEs in a subscriber group, the waiting time for the B1 measurement report is

calculated with the value of EndcUserProfile.timeToTriggerB1Override

attribute and the value of the EndcUserProfile.endcMeasTimeOverride

attribute, if it is set to a value other than default.

If the

EndcUserProfile.timeToTriggerB1Override

attribute is set to the default value, the waiting time for the B1 measurement report is

calculated as the sum of the following values:

- The largest value among the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerB1Override attributes configured for each LTE-to-NR frequency relation
- The value of the EndcUserProfile.endcMeasTimeOverride attribute

Basic Intelligent Connectivity

### 3.4.8 Subscriber Profile-Based Frequency Differentiation of Trigger Quantity Configuration

If a UE group belongs to a subscriber group, the following trigger quantity values are

used:

- If the GUtranFreqRelation.triggerQuantityB1Override attribute is set, its value is used.
- If the GUtranFreqRelation.triggerQuantityB1Override attribute is not set, the value of the ReportConfigB1GUtra.triggerQuantityB1 attribute is used.

If the trigger quantity is RSRP, the following calculations can be used:

- If the UE belongs to a subscriber group and the EndcUserProfile.b1ThresholdRsrpOverride attribute is set, the trigger threshold value is the sum of the values of the EndcUserProfile.b1ThresholdRsrpOverride and the GUtranFreqRelation.b1ThrRsrpFreqOffset attributes.
- If the UE does not belong to a subscriber group, the trigger threshold value is the sum of the ReportConfigB1GUtra.b1ThresholdRsrp and the GUtranFreqRelation.b1ThrRsrpFreqOffset attributes.

If the trigger quantity is RSRQ, the following calculations can be used:

- If the UE belongs to a subscriber group and the EndcUserProfile.b1ThresholdRsrqOverride attribute is set, the trigger threshold value is the sum of the EndcUserProfile.b1ThresholdRsrqOverride and the GUtranFreqRelation.b1ThrRsrqFreqOffset attributes.
- If the UE does not belong to a subscriber group, the trigger threshold value is the sum of the ReportConfigB1GUtra.b1ThresholdRsrq and the GUtranFreqRelation.b1ThrRsrqFreqOffset attributes.

During an inter-eNodeB handover without PSCell change, the trigger quantity for B1

measurements can be overridden both in the source and the target Master Nodes. B1

thresholds are compared in the target Master Node, based on the overridden trigger

quantity, with the measurement on the NR frequency transferred in the X2AP

HANDOVER REQUEST message. The following values are used:

- If RSRP is set in the target Master Node, the RSRP threshold set in the target node is compared with the RSRP of the transferred measurement on the NR frequency.
- Otherwise, the RSRQ is used for the comparison.

### 3.4.9 Subscriber Profile-Based Recurring EN-DC Setup Failure Prevention

Recurring EN-DC setup failure handling can be applied for ASGs.

For the ASGH Framework feature, the following override attributes are introduced under

the EndcUserProfile MO instance:

- EndcUserProfile.loopingEndcProtectionEnabledOverride
- EndcUserProfile.loopingEndcBackoffDurationOverride
- EndcUserProfile.loopingEndcShortScgSessTimeOverride
- EndcUserProfile.loopingEndcConsecFailThrOverride Figure 1 Recurring EN-DC Setup Failure Configuration for ASGs

If the UE is defined in an ASG, the following configurations

can be used:

- If the EndcUserProfile.loopingEndcProtectionEnabledOverride attribute is set to ENABLED and the attributes under the EndcUserProfile MO are configured with a value other than the default value, the attributes under the EndcUserProfile MO instance are used.
- If the EndcUserProfile.loopingEndcProtectionEnabledOverride attribute is set to ENABLED and the attributes under the EndcUserProfile MO are configured with the default values, the attributes under the EUtranCellFDD or the EUtranCellTDD MO instance are used.
- If the EndcUserProfile.loopingEndcProtectionEnabledOverride attribute is set to NO\_OVERRIDE, the attributes under the EUtranCellFDD or the EUtranCellTDD MO instance are used. Note: If the attributes under the EndcUserProfile MO instance are configured and the EUtranCellFDD.loopingEndcProtectionEnabled or the EUtranCellTDD.loopingEndcProtectionEnabled attribute is set to ENABLED, the attributes under the EndcUserProfile MO instance are used.
- If the EndcUserProfile.loopingEndcProtectionEnabledOverride attribute is set to DISABLED, the handling of recurring EN-DC setup failure is disabled for the ASG in which the UE is defined.

If the UE is not assigned to a subscriber group, the

attributes under the EUtranCellFDD or the

EUtranCellTDD MO instance are used.

### 3.4.10 Subscriber Profile-Based Downlink and Uplink Buffer Monitoring for EN-DC Setup

Downlink and uplink buffer monitoring for EN-DC setup can be configured using subscriber

profile-specific thresholds. These thresholds override the cell-specific thresholds

configured in the EUtranCellFDD and the

EUtranCellTDD MOs. For more information on the configuration of

the cell-level thresholds, see Basic Intelligent Connectivity.

Subscriber profile-specific thresholds for downlink buffer monitoring can be configured

using the following attributes:

- EndcUserProfile.endcSetupDlPktAgeThrOverride
- EndcUserProfile.endcSetupDlPktVolThrOverride

Subscriber profile-specific threshold for uplink buffer monitoring can be configured

using the EndcUserProfile.endcSetupUlBsVolThrOverride attribute.

# 4 Network Impact of ASGH Framework

The feature allows

performance differentiation for UEs in an ASG.

Capacity and Performance

The ASGH Framework feature provides the framework of performance differentiation for

a subset of UEs that belong to an ASG. If the UEs that belong to a certain ASG gain

higher performance, the performance of other UEs can decrease. The impact of the

ASGH Framework feature on the network depends on the following conditions:

- The degree of difference between the operator-defined QCIs of the customer and the standardized QCIs.
- The relative proportion of the ASG UEs with differentiated QCI configurations to other UEs.
- The degree of difference between the BLER target of each ASG, if service specific BLER target is used.

When the ASGH Framework feature is activated, configuring the

SubscriberGroupProfile

MO increases the regularity of VoLTE call statistics calculations.

This might cause degradation of less than 1% in the VoLTE Integrity KPI and other

customer-defined KPIs that are affected by the following UE and Radio Bearer (RB)

VoIP counters::

- EUtranCellFDD.pmVoipQualityRbUlLowSampl
- EUtranCellTDD.pmVoipQualityRbUlLowSampl
- EUtranCellFDD.pmVoipQualityRbUlNok
- EUtranCellTDD.pmVoipQualityRbUlNok
- EUtranCellFDD.pmVoipQualityRbUlOk
- EUtranCellTDD.pmVoipQualityRbUlOk
- EUtranCellFDD.pmVoipQualityUeUlLowSampl
- EUtranCellTDD.pmVoipQualityUeUlLowSampl
- EUtranCellFDD.pmVoipQualityUeUlNok
- EUtranCellTDD.pmVoipQualityUeUlNok
- EUtranCellFDD.pmVoipQualityUeUlOk
- EUtranCellTDD.pmVoipQualityUeUlOk

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

the number of complete HARQ failures in the uplink.

Events

The feature adds the event parameter EVENT\_PARAM\_SUBSCRIBER\_GROUP\_ID, which indicates

the index of ASG, to several existing events in the Flexible Counters feature.

For a full list with detailed information about PM events, see the list files in the

List Files library folder.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for ASGH Framework

The feature enables ASG-based uplink and downlink BLER target

configuration.

## 8.1 Configure an ASG with Dynamic BLER Target

The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature enables the configuration of a dynamic BLER

target for ASGs.

The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is beneficial for services without strict

packet delay requirements, for example internet traffic. The feature introduces a

machine learning algorithm that periodically adjusts the downlink BLER target for

each UE in the configured ASGs. This is done according to the current inter-cell

interference situation.

Prerequisites

- The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is activated.

Steps

1. Create a SubscriberGroupProfile MO instance to define the ASG.
2. Define the percentage of the UE population to be included in the ASG by setting the SubscriberGroupProfile.selectionProbability attribute.
3. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMax attribute to a positive value. It is not recommended to set this attribute to a value that is higher than 60. The maximum BLER target can be decreased, if any of the following PIs increase: PDCP Downlink Packet Loss Rate DL RLC Error Rate
4. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMin attribute. It is not recommended to set this attribute to a value that is lower than 10 except in case of low load in the cell. If the cell load is low, the default value of 1 can be used to improve performance.

## 8.2 Configure an ASG with Static BLER Target for VoLTE UEs

If the AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is activated, an ASG with static

downlink BLER target can be configured for VoLTE UEs.

The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is not applicable to voice services. If the

feature is activated, a static constant BLER target is assigned to all UE sessions

with active voice radio bearers. Dynamic BLER target is assigned to all other UE

sessions.

An ASG with dynamic BLER target deactivated must be configured in the following

cases:

- If at least one ASG is created for MBB traffic with dynamic BLER target activated and the SubscriberGroupProfile.selectionProbability attribute set to lower than 100.
- If service-specific BLER target is used.

Prerequisites

- The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is activated.

Steps

1. Create a SubscriberGroupProfile MO instance to define the ASG.
2. Set the qci member of the SubscriberGroupProfile.bearerTriggerList attribute to 1.
3. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.profilePriority attribute to 10, or a value that is higher than the other ASGs.
4. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMax attribute to -1 to configure a static BLER target of 10%.

## 8.3 Configure Downlink BLER Target

The legacy

downlink BLER target can be enabled by performing this task.

Steps

1. Set the EUtranCellFDD.dlBlerTargetEnabled attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.dlBlerTargetEnabled attribute to true.

Service Specific BLER Target

## 8.4 Configure Downlink BLER Target with Service Specific BLER Target

If the service

specific BLER target is enabled, a separate downlink BLER target can be configured for each

ASG.

Steps

1. Configure ASGH Framework by grouping UEs according to QCI in the SubscriberGroupProfile.bearerTriggerList attribute. The different configuration of the ASGH trigger list leads to different grouping schemes. If a different BLER target is needed for a different QCI, the ASGs can be configured based on the qci element of the SubscriberGroupProfile.bearerTriggerList attribute. Each ASG can have its own BLER target setting. If multiple QCI bearers co-exist in a UE, the BLER target of the QCI with the higher priority of the ASG takes effect for all bearers in the UE. Note: If a UE adheres to the selection criteria of more than one ASG, the profile with the higher value in the SubscriberGroupProfile.profilePriority attribute is selected. For more information on ASG configuration, see ASGH Framework.
2. Set the value of the EUtranCellFDD.blerTargetConfigEnabled attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.blerTargetConfigEnabled attribute, or both to true. Note: If the default downlink BLER target of 5% needs to be kept for VoLTE UEs, create a new subscriber group for UEs with VOIP bearer and set the value of the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlHarqBlerTarget attribute to 5.
3. Configure the downlink BLER target with the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlHarqBlerTarget attribute. Note: When configuring the service specific BLER target, the following needs to be considered: The range of the BLER target setting is between 1% and 100%. Any updates in BLER target configuration take effect immediately.

## 8.5 Configure Uplink BLER Target

The legacy uplink BLER target can be configured by performing this task.

Steps

1. Configure the uplink BLER target with the following attributes:
    - EUtranCellFDD.ulBlerTargetEnabled or EUtranCellTDD.ulBlerTargetEnabled The ulBlerTargetEnabled attribute turns on and off configurable uplink BLER target.
    - EUtranCellFDD.ulHarqVolteBlerTarget or EUtranCellTDD.ulHarqVolteBlerTarget The ulHarqVolteBlerTarget attribute is used to configure the uplink BLER target of VoLTE UEs. This BLER target is used for all uplink transmissions for UEs that have a QCI 1 bearer configured. If a UE does not have a QCI 1 bearer configured, the normal uplink BLER target is used.

Service Specific BLER Target

## 8.6 Configure Uplink BLER Target with Service Specific BLER Target

If the service

specific BLER target is enabled, a separate uplink BLER target can be configured for each

ASG.

Steps

1. Configure ASGH Framework by grouping UEs according to QCI in the SubscriberGroupProfile.bearerTriggerList attribute. The different configuration of the ASGH trigger list leads to different grouping schemes. If a different BLER target is needed for a different QCI, the ASGs can be configured based on the qci element of the SubscriberGroupProfile.bearerTriggerList attribute. Each ASG can have its own BLER target setting. If multiple QCI bearers co-exist in a UE, the BLER target of the QCI with the higher priority of the ASG takes effect for all bearers in the UE. Note: If a UE adheres to the selection criteria of more than one ASG, the profile with the higher value in the SubscriberGroupProfile.profilePriority attribute is selected. For more information on ASG configuration, see ASGH Framework.
2. Set the value of the EUtranCellFDD.blerTargetConfigEnabled attribute or the EUtranCellTDD.blerTargetConfigEnabled attribute, or both to true. Note: If the default uplink BLER target of 5% needs to be kept for VoLTE UEs, create a new subscriber group for UEs with VOIP bearer and set the value of the SubscriberGroupProfile.ulHarqBlerTarget attribute to 5.
3. Configure the uplink BLER target with the SubscriberGroupProfile.ulHarqBlerTarget attribute. Note: When configuring the service specific BLER target, the following needs to be considered: The range of the BLER target setting is between 1% and 100%. Any updates in BLER target configuration take effect immediately.

## 8.7 Activate Dynamic BLER Target with Service-Specific BLER Target

If the AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is activated, dynamic BLER target can be

used together with service-specific BLER target.

If the AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature and service-specific BLER target are

activated together, separate ASGs can be configured to use dynamic BLER target or

static BLER target optimized for a specific service.

In this configuration example, the following ASGs are created:

- An ASG for VoLTE UEs with a static BLER target of 5%
- An ASG for UEs with MBB traffic with a dynamic BLER target range of [10, 60]

Prerequisites

- The AI Powered DL Link Adaptation feature is activated.

Steps

1. Activate service-specific BLER target by setting the EUtranCellFDD.blerTargetConfigEnabled attribute to 1.
2. Create and configure a SubscriberGroupProfile MO instance for VoLTE UEs.
    1. Set the qci member of the SubscriberGroupProfile.bearerTriggerList attribute to 1.
    2. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlHarqBlerTarget attribute to 5.
    3. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMax attribute to -1.
    4. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.profilePriority attribute to 10.
    5. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.selectionProbability attribute to 100.
3. Create and configure a SubscriberGroupProfile MO instance for MBB UEs.
    1. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMax attribute to 60.
    2. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.dlDynBlerTargetMin attribute to 10.
    3. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.profilePriority attribute to 1.
    4. Set the SubscriberGroupProfile.selectionProbability attribute to 100.

## 8.8 Example Configuration of Time to Trigger B1 Measurements

Multiple B1 measurements can be configured for the UE with different times to trigger

the B1 measurement for each NR frequency in an LTE-to-NR frequency relation.

The GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute is only used

if the following conditions apply:

- The UE does not belong to a subscriber group for which the EndcUserProfile.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute is configured. If the UE belongs to a subscriber group, the EndcUserProfile.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute is used, if set to a value other than default.
- The GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute is set to a value other than default.

Example 1   Overriding Configuration for UEs Not Defined in a Subscriber Group

The following configuration is used before the

GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute is

set:

- The ReportConfigB1GUtra.timeToTriggerB1 attribute is set to 64.

The GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute is

configured with the following values for different frequencies:

- For the NR frequency Frequency1, the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute is set to 40.
- For the NR frequency Frequency2, the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute is set to the default value, -1000.
- For the NR frequency Frequency3, the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute is set to 80.

These settings have the following results:

- For Frequency2, the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute is set to the default value. Therefore, the overriding value has no effect, and the original ReportConfigB1GUtra.timeToTriggerB1 attribute value of 64 is used.
- For Frequency1 and Frequency3, the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute is set to a value other than default. The ReportConfigB1GUtra.timeToTriggerB1 attribute is overridden with the time to trigger value of 40 on Frequency1, and 80 on Frequency3.

Example 2   Overriding Configuration for UEs Defined in a Subscriber Group

The following configuration is used before the

GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute is

set:

- The ReportConfigB1GUtra.timeToTriggerB1 attribute is set to 64.

The following configuration exists for the UE subscriber group:

- The EndcUserProfile.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute is set to 100.

The GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute is

configured with the following values for different frequencies:

- For the NR frequency Frequency1, the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute is set to 40.
- For the NR frequency Frequency2, the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute is set to the default value, -1000.
- For the NR frequency Frequency3, the GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute is set to 80.

These settings have the following result:

- Because the UE is part of a subscriber group, the EndcUserProfile.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute overrides the ReportConfigB1GUtra.timeToTriggerB1 attribute, and the overriding value of 100 is used. The GUtranFreqRelation.timeToTriggerB1Override attribute settings do not have any effect for the different frequencies.

## 8.9 Example Configuration of Trigger Quantity, RSRP and RSRQ, for B1 Measurements

The trigger quantity of the B1 measurements can be configured for the different

LTE-to-NR frequency relations. This way, different NR frequencies can be assigned different

trigger quantities for triggering EN-DC-triggered handover and EN-DC setup.

The GUtranFreqRelation.triggerQuantityB1Override attribute is only

used when set to a value other than default.

Example 3   Overriding Configuration for UEs Not Defined in a Subscriber Group

The following configuration is used before the

GUtranFreqRelation.triggerQuantityB1Override attribute is

set:

- The ReportConfigB1GUtra.b1ThresholdRsrp attribute is set to -140.
- The ReportConfigB1GUtra.b1ThresholdRsrq attribute is set to -430.
- The ReportConfigB1GUtra.triggerQuantityB1 attribute is set to SS\_RSRP.

The GUtranFreqRelation.triggerQuantityB1Override attribute is

configured with the following values for different frequencies:

- For the NR frequency Frequency1, the attribute is set to SS\_RSRQ.
- For the NR frequency Frequency2, the attribute is set to the default value, NO\_OVERRIDE.
- For the NR frequency Frequency3, the attribute is set to SS\_RSRP.

These settings have the following results:

- For Frequency1, the GUtranFreqRelation.triggerQuantityB1Override attribute overrides the ReportConfigB1GUtra.triggerQuantityB1 attribute, and the SS\_RSRQ value is used.
- For Frequency2, the GUtranFreqRelation.triggerQuantityB1Override attribute is set to the default value, so it has no effect. The original ReportConfigB1GUtra.triggerQuantityB1 attribute value of SS\_RSRP is used.
- For Frequency3, the GUtranFreqRelation.triggerQuantityB1Override attribute overrides the ReportConfigB1GUtra.triggerQuantityB1 attribute, even though the values are the same, SS\_RSRP.

Example 4   Overriding Configuration for UEs Defined in a Subscriber Group

The following configuration is used before the

GUtranFreqRelation.triggerQuantityB1Override attribute is

set:

- The ReportConfigB1GUtra.b1ThresholdRsrp attribute is set to -140.
- The ReportConfigB1GUtra.b1ThresholdRsrq attribute is set to -430.
- The ReportConfigB1GUtra.triggerQuantityB1 attribute is set to SS\_RSRP.

The following configuration exists for the UE subscriber group:

- The EndcUserProfile.b1ThresholdRsrpOverride attribute is set to -120.
- The EndcUserProfile.b1ThresholdRsrqOverride attribute is set to -400.

The GUtranFreqRelation.triggerQuantityB1Override attribute is

configured with the following values for different frequencies:

- For the NR frequency Frequency1, the attribute is set to SS\_RSRQ.
- For the NR frequency Frequency2, the attribute is set to the default value, NO\_OVERRIDE.
- For the NR frequency Frequency3, the attribute is set to SS\_RSRP.

These settings have the following results:

- For Frequency1, the GUtranFreqRelation.triggerQuantityB1Override attribute overrides the ReportConfigB1GUtra.triggerQuantityB1 attribute, and the SS\_RSRQ value is taken into consideration. The EndcUserProfile.b1ThresholdRsrqOverride attribute setting overrides the ReportConfigB1GUtra.b1ThresholdRsrq attribute, and therefore the value -400 is used.
- For Frequency2, the GUtranFreqRelation.triggerQuantityB1Override attribute is set to the default value, so it does not have any effect. The original value of the ReportConfigB1GUtra.triggerQuantityB1, SS\_RSRP is taken into consideration. The ReportConfigB1GUtra.b1ThresholdRsrp attribute is overridden by the EndcUserProfile.b1ThresholdRsrpOverride attribute, which is set to -120, so this value is used.
- For Frequency3, the GUtranFreqRelation.triggerQuantityB1Override attribute overrides the ReportConfigB1GUtra.triggerQuantityB1 attribute, but the values are the same, so SS\_RSRP is taken into consideration. The ReportConfigB1GUtra.b1ThresholdRsrp attribute is overridden by the EndcUserProfile.b1ThresholdRsrpOverride attribute, which is set to -120, so this value is used.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 19.Q4: Service Specific BLER Target

The Service Specific BLER Target enhancement provides a solution for Block Error

Ratio (BLER) target configuration under uplink and downlink non-Carrier Aggregation

scenarios for ASGH UEs.

| Feature Name:           | ASGH Framework                     |

Operation

The Service Specific BLER Target enhancement is deactivated by default and the legacy

BLER target calculation values for all ASGH groups are in place. This results in a

default 5% value for VoLTE users and 10% value for other service type UEs, for both

uplink and downlink.

After the enhancement is activated with the

blerTargetConfigEnabled attribute, the values set for the

SubscriberGroupProfile.ulHarqBlerTarget and

SubscriberGroupProfile.dlHarqBlerTarget attributes override

the values of default legacy attributes for uplink and downlink.
