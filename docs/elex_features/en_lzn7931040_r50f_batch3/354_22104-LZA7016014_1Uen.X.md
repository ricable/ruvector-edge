Summary

The HTTPS feature introduces security for data accessible over an HTTP web server by

the introduction of an HTTPS web server.

The HTTPS feature adds security to web servers with HTTPS access service for O&amp;M

traffic on the node. The HTTPS web server feature makes it possible for a client to

communicate with a node in a secure way by using HTTPS and standard port 443. In

addition, port 9443 is reserved for future use.

HTTPS uses TLS as the encryption layer to protect the traffic. HTTPS can be activated and

deactivated. When HTTPS is deactivated, HTTP is activated. This results in unsecure

communication.

The main benefit of this feature is the introduction of security for all data that is

published on the Web Server.

# 2 Dependencies of HTTPS Web Server for OAM

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

This feature is applicable for all OSE CPP-based nodes. No special hardware for this

feature..

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Feature Limitation

No limitations for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation

Network Requirements

The following things are required before feature activation:

- Certificate enrollment for the Security MO

Feature Functionality

This enhancement is disabled by default, and web server mode is set to HTTP.

Toggling between HTTP and HTTPS is controlled via the secmode COLI

command. Thus, both HTTP and HTTPS server functions are controlled by the seclevel

interface. The seclevel interface stores HTTPS setting information, which is used in

the webserver to set the port that the webserver listens to. Observability of the

configured options (HTTPS server ON, HTTPS server OFF) is visible in the existing

Security MO, by using the new read only

webserver attribute. The HTTP server uses port 80. When the

HTTPS server is activated, the web server listens to the loopback interface on port

80 for HTTP traffic and a tunnel from port 443 to the loopback interface is

established. The HTTPS functionality listens to port 443/9443 and configures the

TLS. Port 443 is used for communication while all requests received on port 9443 are

rejected. Traffic received over port 443 is forwarded to the loopback interface and

traffic received over loopback interface is forwarded to the new socket used for

HTTPS. The webserver handles the HTTP messages. TLS version 1.2 and version 1.0 are

used. They provide security with the following mechanisms:

- A basic TLS handshake procedure at server authentication.
- A cipher, provided within openSSL from ENEA.
- A certificate, where Node Credentials are used. Certificate enrollment for the Security MO is a prerequisite to turn on HTTPS.

# 4 Network Impact

Capacity and Performance

The feature does not have any impact on coverage capacity and performance.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

To enable HTTPS usage, support for deployment of HTTPS on the network level is

needed. If a client runs standalone or from ENM, it must support HTTPS to connect to

the node using the HTTPS web server. If a client does not support HTTPS, HTTP must

be used. ENM can be used as an HTTPS client from ENM 17.Q4 or later. OSS-RC does not

support HTTPS as a client. ENM and OSS-RC can both be used as HTTP clients.
