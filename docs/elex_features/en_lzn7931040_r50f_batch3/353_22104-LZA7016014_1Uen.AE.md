# 1 Uplink Adaptive Retransmission Enhancement Overview

This feature reduces the fragmentation rate of the uplink spectrum by replacing

non-adaptive retransmissions with adaptive

retransmissions.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                    |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 1447                           |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                       |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400                           |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                    |

Summary

The feature replaces non-adaptive retransmissions with adaptive retransmissions in the uplink

spectrum to reduce the fragmentation rate of the uplink spectrum. With reduced

fragmentation, the uplink spectrum can be used more efficiently.

Activating this feature while the Uplink Frequency-Selective Scheduling feature is

activated can lead to more fragments in the uplink spectrum.

# 3 Feature Operation of Uplink Adaptive Retransmission Enhancement

This feature improves uplink performance by transferring non-adaptive retransmission

to adaptive retransmission, which reduces the fragmentation in the uplink

spectrum.

Feature Operation Sequence Diagram

Figure 2   Example of Uplink Transmission with Four Non-Adaptive Retransmissions

Process Steps

1. The impact level of each retransmission is estimated.Note: The feature ignores the impact level of continuous retransmissions that are near the PUCCH and PRACH edge.
2. The candidate queue is prepared.
3. The number of queued candidates is restricted in the value of the EUtranCellFDD.noOfEnhAdptReTxCand or the EUtranCellTDD.noOfEnhAdptReTxCand attribute.
4. PUSCH allocation is performed.

The EUtranCellFDD.noOfEnhAdptReTxCand or the

EUtranCellTDD.noOfEnhAdptReTxCand attribute can be set to

following values:

| 0                          |    | This is the default setting. The Uplink Adaptive Retransmission                                 Enhancement feature is deactivated. UEs are not added to the                                 candidate queue.             |
|----------------------------|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                            |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -1                         |    | This is the recommended setting. The eNodeB configures the attribute                                 automatically.                                                                                                       |
|                            |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| A positive integer up to 5 |    | The recommended positive value is 3. The feature is activated, and                                 the set value is the maximum number of candidates queued for                                 adaptive retransmissions. |

# 4 Network Impact of Uplink Adaptive Retransmission Enhancement

This feature can increase PRB use, uplink UE and cell throughput, and average CCE use

on the PDCCH.

Capacity and Performance

This feature has the following impact on performance:

- PRB use increases.
- Uplink UE and cell throughput can increase, especially for large-buffer UEs in a cell with a large-packet UE and several small-packet UEs.
- The average CCE use increases on the PDCCH. This results in higher PDCCH interference, especially for scenarios or cells in which the PDCCH load is already high.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Uplink Adaptive Retransmission Enhancement

This feature introduces parameters to restrict the number of candidate SEs that can

queue for enhanced adaptive retransmission.

# 6 Performance of Uplink Adaptive Retransmission Enhancement

This feature can increase the value of Resource Indicators (RIs) and KPIs.

KPIs

Table 3   Resource Indicators (RIs)

| RI                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Uplink PRB Utilization        | The value of this RI increases when the Uplink Adaptive                                 Retransmission Enhancement feature is activated.                                                                       |
| Uplink UE and Cell Throughput | The value of this PI can increase when the Uplink Adaptive                                 Retransmission Enhancement feature is activated, especially with a                                 large-buffer UE. |
| Average PDCCH CCE Utilization | The value of this RI increases when the Uplink Adaptive                                 Retransmission Enhancement feature is activated and the PDCCH                                 interference is higher.  |

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
