# 1 Basic Voice over NR Overview

This feature provides traffic functions and protocol procedures for establishing,

maintaining, and releasing a voice call in NR.

Summary

This feature supports VoNR calls, which allows the handling of voice traffic directly in NR SA

instead of the EPS fallback to LTE function.

The feature enables the modification of QoS parameters and the configuration of the RLC layer

to use unacknowledged mode.

The setup of multiple QoS flows and DRBs for each PDU session is supported for intra-NR mobility

scenarios and IRAT inter-system mobility scenarios to LTE.

NR mobility supports priority for voice services. This prevents handover to an NR

cell where voice service cannot be maintained.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitations

Voice quality, retainability, or coverage enhancing functions and optimizations are

not included. For example, voice-adapted scheduling is not supported.

Network Requirements

This feature requires a VoNR-capable UE.

ENM version 19.13 or later is required for this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of Basic Voice over NR

This feature supports voice calls for VoNR-capable UEs with basic VoNR, which allows

the handling of voice traffic directly in NR

SA.

The Basic Voice over NR feature supports the establishment of voice flows on a dedicated

DRB in the PDU session for IMS services. A PDU session for IMS services needs the

support of at least two DRBs. One DRB carries the default non-GBR flow for IMS signaling

with RLC set to acknowledged mode. The second DRB carries the GBR flow for the

conversational voice with RLC set to unacknowledged mode.

The configuration is provided to control EPS fallback or VoNR at cell level when it is

required to set up a new voice QoS flow.

Multiple DRBs for non-GBR flows can be set up simultaneously during the PDU Session

Resource Setup procedure. Additional DRBs for both non-GBR and GBR flows can be

established during the PDU Session Resource Modify procedure.

# 4 Network Impact of Basic Voice over NR

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

This feature requires a VoNR-capable UE.

# 5 Parameters for Basic Voice over NR

The feature is affected by attributes that can be used to set whether VoNR or EPS

fallback is triggered.

# 6 Performance of Basic Voice over NR

There are no KPIs, counters, and events for this

feature.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators.

Counters

The performance of the feature can be observed with the counters listed for QoS Framework. 5QI = 1 and 5QI = 5 counters are

associated with the performance of the Basic Voice over NR feature.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Basic Voice over NR

To use the Basic Voice over NR feature, some 5QI-related parameters must be

configured according to the recommended settings.

5QI can be configured according to Table 3 for

this feature:

Table 3   IMS Voice

| Name                 |   5QI Value | RLC   | Service Type   |
|----------------------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| SIP DRB              |           5 | AM    | IMS signaling  |
| Voice DRB            |           1 | UM    | VoIP           |
| Conversational video |           2 | UM    | -              |

If no MO instance of the CUCP5qi.profile5qi,

CUUP5qi.profile5qi, DU5qi.profile5qi attribute

matches the 5QI value, the default values of the attributes of the

CUCP5qi, CUUP5qi, or DU5qi

MO instance are used.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 24.Q3.0: Enhanced Observability for DRB Retainability

This feature enhancement improves observability by introducing retainability KPIs

that do not treat inter-gNodeB handover as normal release.

| Feature Name           | Basic Voice over NR   |
|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5219          |
| Value Package Name     | Voice over NR         |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4017          |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node   |
| Access Type            | NR                    |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory             |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces retainability KPIs that do not treat inter-gNodeB

handover as normal release. It also introduces PM counters related to inter-gNodeB

handover and IRAT handover. This allows for more accurate observability for

VoNR.

Capacity and Performance

The introduced KPIs are expected to degrade compared to the KPIs that are planned to

be deprecated. This is because of the change in the formulas.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the following retainability KPIs to replace

existing KPIs that are planned to be deprecated:

- DRB Retainability Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI without outgoing inter-gNodeB HO UEs
- DRB Retainability Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI without outgoing inter-gNodeB HO UEs, gNodeB triggered only
- DRB Retainability Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI without outgoing inter-gNodeB HO UEs, RRC Inactive State
- DRB Retainability Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI without outgoing inter-gNodeB HO UEs, RRC Inactive State, gNodeB triggered only

The following retainability KPIs are planned to be deprecated:

- DRB Retainability Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI
- DRB Retainability Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI, gNodeB triggered only
- DRB Retainability Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI, RRC Inactive State
- DRB Retainability Percentage of Active Lost per mapped 5QI, RRC Inactive State, gNodeB triggered only

It is recommended to use the introduced KPIs instead of the KPIs that are planned to

be deprecated.

For more information on the KPIs and associated formulas, see Key Performance Indicators.

This feature enhancement introduces the following PM counters:

- NRCellCU.pmHoExeSuccOutDrbEutran5qi
- NRCellCU.pmHoExeSuccOutDrbInterGnb5qi

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 24.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions

also.
