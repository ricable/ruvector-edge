Summary

The

feature optimizes the handling of system settings, reduces the service downtime for

restart and software upgrade. This reduction is more noticeable when the node is

configured with a large number of cells.

# 2 Dependencies of Minimized Downtime at Software Upgrade

The feature has no dependencies or

limitations.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Minimized Downtime at Software Upgrade

This feature implements more efficient algorithms and optimization for database handling

during system restart. Therefore, it reduces the downtime during upgrades.

# 4 Network Impact of Minimized Downtime at Software Upgrade

Capacity and Performance

The feature reduces the service downtime for software upgrade process. The reduction

is remarkable for large configuration with many cells.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Minimized Downtime at Software Upgrade

The

feature has no associated parameters.

Parameters

There are no introduced, affecting, or affected parameters associated with this

feature.

# 6 Performance of Minimized Downtime at Software Upgrade

The

feature has no related KPIs, counters, or events.

Key Performance Indicators

The feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

The feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
