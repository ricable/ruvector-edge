# 1 NR Flexible Channel Bandwidth Overview

The feature allows CRB blanking in the NR cell to avoid intra-frequency interference

with other RATs.

Summary

The feature allows CRB blanking, that is, it flexibly reconfigures NR channels to be

accommodated in the restricted NR bandwidth. This enables the coexistence of an NR

cell and a neighbor cell of another RAT type, if the blanked CRB region size is

compatible.

To ensure that the NR cell can be functional, the feature does a consistency check for the

maximum number of blanked CRBs based on the bandwidth.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitations

The following limitations apply to the feature:

- NR CRB blanking is only supported on the edges of the cell bandwidth.
- The regulatory requirements for radio transmission and reception might not be fulfilled for the reduced bandwidth.
- The downlink available bandwidth must be in range of the uplink available bandwidth for reciprocity-based SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO.
- Only full bandwidth SRS configuration is supported when CRB blanking is enabled.
- TRS resource shifting is not supported in FDD 10-MHz configurations together with CRB blanking.
- For 100-MHz bandwidth and DDDDDDDSUU TDD pattern with 6:4:4 special slot configuration, only 20 MHz and 40 MHz CRB blanking is supported.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

CRB Blanking in Cells with NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Flexible Channel Bandwidth

The feature blanks a range of CRBs in the NR cell to make room for the resources of a

neighbor cell of another RAT

type.

The

feature allows the user to blank a customizable number of CRBs on the edge of the

carrier bandwidth. The blanked CRBs can be on either side of the carrier bandwidth, or

on both sides.

Figure 1   Resource Block Blanking

The CRBs of the NR cell can be blanked in a set range to make interference-free

coexistence possible with a cell of another RAT type. Downlink and uplink CRB blanking

can be controlled separately through MO attribute pairs. In the downlink, the following

attributes configure blanking:

- NRCellDU.dlStartCrb
- NRCellDU.dlAvailableCrbs

In the uplink, the following attributes configure blanking:

- NRCellDU.ulStartCrb
- NRCellDU.ulAvailableCrbs

NR channels are dynamically moved and accommodated based on the restricted bandwidth. In

case any of the affected channels or signals are manually configured, they must be

placed within the range used by NR at cell setup.

The following NR signals are affected:

- CSI-IM
- CSI-RS
- TRS
- SRS
- SSB

The following NR channels are affected:

- PDCCH
- PDSCH
- PRACH
- PUCCH
- PUSCH

If the number of available CRBs is insufficient for PDCCH or PRACH allocation, the

cell setup is rejected, and the Inconsistent Configuration alarm is raised on the

NRCellDU

MO.

The following CORESET characteristics are configured for NR standalone deployment with 10

MHz bandwidth in FDD or with 20 MHz bandwidth in TDD:

- CORESET#0 is configured to 24 CRBs with 2 symbols.
- CORESET#1 duration is fixed to 2.

For other bandwidths and for EN-DC, the following CORESET characteristics are

configured:

- CORESET#0 is configured to 48 CRBs with 1 symbol.

To ensure that the NR cell is functional, the feature performs a consistency check for

the maximum number of blanked CRBs based on the bandwidth.

## 3.2 TRS Configuration

The feature allows TRS configuration with the following attributes:

- NRCellDU.trsConfigMode
- NRCellDU.trsModeSelected

If the NRCellDU.trsConfigMode attribute is set to

AUTO, the system selects the TRS configuration according to the

bandwidth. The NRCellDU.trsModeSelected attribute shows the selected

configuration.

If the NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support feature is activated and

the P-BWP = 20 MHz and F-BWP = 30 MHz or F-BWP = 40 MHz values

are configured in the cell, the full bandwidth configuration is

used, NRCellDU.trsModeSelected =

FULL\_BW.

If the NRCellDU.trsConfigMode attribute is set to any other value,

that configuration is selected, and the NRCellDU.trsModeSelected

attribute shows the same value.

## 3.3 CRB Blanking with Advanced Single-User and Multi-User MIMO

The downlink available bandwidth must be in the range of the uplink available

bandwidth for advanced single-user MIMO and multi-user MIMO.

The ranges are represented by the following attributes:

- NRCellDU.dlStartCrb
- NRCellDU.dlAvailableCrbs
- NRCellDU.ulStartCrb
- NRCellDU.ulAvailableCrbs

The downlink available bandwidth range begins at the value of the

NRCellDU.dlStartCrb attribute. The end of the range is the sum of

the NRCellDU.dlStartCrb and

NRCellDU.dlAvailableCrbs attribute values minus 1.

The uplink available bandwidth range begins at the value of the

NRCellDU.ulStartCrb attribute. The end of the range is the sum of

the NRCellDU.ulStartCrb and

NRCellDU.ulAvailableCrbs attribute values minus 1.

The downlink available bandwidth is in the range of the uplink available bandwidth if the

following criteria apply:

- The value of the NRCellDU.dlStartCrb is equal to or greater than the value of the NRCellDU.ulStartCrb attribute.
- The sum of the NRCellDU.dlStartCrb and NRCellDU.dlAvailableCrbs attribute values is equal to or less than the sum of the NRCellDU.ulStartCrb and NRCellDU.ulAvailableCrbs attribute values.

MIMO

## 3.4 CRB Blanking in Cells with NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support

The NR Reduced UE Bandwidth Support feature and the NR Flexible Channel Bandwidth

feature can be activated simultaneously.

CRB Blanking in FDD Cells

CRB blanking is possible for FDD cells in the top of the full carrier bandwidth if

the P-BWP is configured in the bottom position of the cell bandwidth.

If the P-BWP is configured in a top position on the cell bandwidth, CRB blanking is

not allowed in any part of the bandwidth.

To use the NR Flexible Channel Bandwidth feature, the following attributes are

required to be set to 0:

- NRCellDU.dlStartCrb
- NRCellDU.ulStartCrb

CRB blanking is not possible in the P-BWP. To not blank CRB in P-BWP, the

following attributes are required to be set to a value equal or higher than

106:

- NRCellDU.dlAvailableCrbs
- NRCellDU.ulAvailableCrbs

CRB Blanking in TDD Cells

CRB blanking is possible for TDD cells at the following parts of the bandwidth:

- The top of the full carrier bandwidth
- The bottom of the full carrier bandwidth Note: In this case the blanked CRB is positioned at the bottom of the bandwidth, blocked out from the F-BWP, while the P-BWP is moved above the blanked CRB.

If the blanked CRB is configured at the bottom of the bandwidth, the F-BWP

BWP.startRB value must be

0,

and the P-BWP must be configured according to the following rules:

- BWP.startRB for downlink P-BWP = round up to integer (NRCellDU.dlStartCrb / 6) × 6
- BWP.startRB for uplink P-BWP = round up to integer (NRCellDU.ulStartCrb / 6) × 6

In this case, the BWP.startRB attribute for downlink and uplink

P-BWP must have the same value, and the NRCellDU.dlStartCrb and

NRCellDU.ulStartCrb attributes must have the same value.

CRB blanking is not possible in the P-BWP. To not blank CRB in P-BWP, the following

attributes are required to be set to a value equal or higher than the value of the

BWP.numberOfRBs attribute in the P-BWP used by the cell:

- NRCellDU.dlAvailableCrbs
- NRCellDU.ulAvailableCrbs

# 4 Network Impact of NR Flexible Channel Bandwidth

The feature can reduce interference between an NR cell and a neighbor cell of another

RAT type, and it affects IEs on the RRC

interface.

Capacity and Performance

The feature reduces interference between an NR cell and a neighbor cell of another

RAT type by freeing NR resources.

The restricted number of CRBs available to NR might have a negative impact on uplink

and downlink NR throughput.

Blanking more than the floor function of 25% of the number of CRBs in uplink might

cause a degradation of random access success rate in NR standalone configurations.

This is because half of the common PUCCH resources are allocated in the blanked

region.

Interfaces

The feature affects the following IEs on the RRC interface through limiting uplink

and downlink CRBs in NR:

- CSI-FrequencyOccupation
- CSI-RS-ResourceMapping
- CSI-ReportConfig
- ControlResourceSet
- SearchSpace
- RACH-ConfigGeneric
- PUCCH-Resource
- RateMatchPattern

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Flexible Channel Bandwidth

The feature introduces parameters for TRS configuration, and uses existing parameters

# 6 Performance of NR Flexible Channel Bandwidth

The performance of the feature can be observed through PM counters related to CRB

availability.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The following counters related to PUSCH, PDCCH, and PDSCH resources are affected when

the feature restricts the available uplink and downlink resource blocks:

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymCsiRs
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymAvailDl
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymAvailUl
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymAvailPdcch
- NRCellDU.pmCellDowntimeAuto

The number of available downlink CRBs for advanced single-user MIMO or multi-user

MIMO can decrease if downlink CRBs are blanked. This can be observed with the

following PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMimoUserDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvSuMimoLayerDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvSuMimoTxRankDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMuMimoLayerDistr
- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPdschAdvMuMimoTxRankDistr

The feature can decrease the pmEbsMacRBSymAvailPdcch EBS counter

when the feature restricts the available downlink resource blocks.

For more information on EBS counters associated with the feature, see Lists and Delta Lists.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 22.Q1: TDD Support for NR Flexible Channel Bandwidth

This feature enhancement enables CRB blanking for NR TDD cells.

| Access Type:            | NR                              |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement allows blanking CRBs for NR TDD cells for multiple

bandwidths. This enables the coexistence of an NR TDD cell and a neighbor cell of

another RAT type, if the blanked CRB region size is compatible.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement reduces interference between an NR TDD cell and a neighbor

cell of another RAT type by freeing NR resources.

The restricted number of CRBs available to NR might have a negative impact on uplink

and downlink NR throughput.

| Access Type            | NR                              |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                        |

Capacity and Performance

Blanking more than the floor function of 25% of the number of CRBs can have an impact

on accessibility in standalone configuration as half of the common PUCCH resources

are allocated in the blanked region.

Operation

Extended CRB blanking rules apply only to non-ESS cells, so the

NRSectorCarrier.essScPairId attribute must be empty.

Otherwise, the configuration of extended CRB blanking might get blocked. For CRB

blanking rules related to ESS cells, see Ericsson Spectrum Sharing All-In-One User

Guide.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
