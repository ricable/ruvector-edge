Summary

The NR DSCP Mapping Based on 5QI and QCI feature introduces the possibility to configure the

DSCP used for transport network QoS for both NR SA-capable UEs and EN-DC-capable

UEs. It is possible to configure different DSCP values based on different 5QIs

provided by the AMF and QCIs provided by the Master Node (eNodeB). The operator can

prioritize traffic based on 5QIs and QCIs with this feature. This way, UEs can have

different QoS used by the transport network QoS, which determines traffic

classification and quality for network data.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR DSCP Mapping Based on 5QI and QCI

This feature allows differentiated QoS handling based on 5QI and QCI.

## 3.1 DSCP Mapping Based on 5QI

DSCP values based on 5QI can be mapped to the transport network QoS in the PDU

sessions to the UPF.

The mapping of DSCP values based on 5QI can be configured through the

CUUP5qi.dscp attribute. This feature also provides slice-specific

QoS, which means that separate DSCP values can be configured for each slice by

activating the RAN Slicing Framework feature.

The 5G core network sends the following messages to the gNodeB, containing the 5QI:

- NGAP: PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST
- NGAP: PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST
- NGAP: INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST

Operational Process

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The gNodeB receives an incoming PDU session resource setup or modification request. The request contains QoS flows, which include a QoS flow identifier and a 5QI.
2. The gNodeB checks if the RAN Slicing Framework feature is activated. It also checks if an operator-defined, slice-specific QoS mapping is configured by checking the respective S-NSSAI associated with the 5QI. Slice-specific QoS mapping is configured if the following conditions are met: The CUUP5qiTable.default5qiTable attribute is set to false. The ResourcePartitionMember.pLMNIdList attribute is set to the preferred PLMN ID. The ResourcePartitionMember.sNSSAIList attribute is set to the preferred S-NSSAI. The ResourcePartition.related5qiTableRef attribute refers to the CUUP5qiTable MO.
    1. The gNodeB checks if the matching QoS profile for the 5QI exists. The matching QoS profile for the 5QI exists if the following conditions are met: The CUUP5qiTable.default5qiTable attribute is set to false. The 5QI is set to the corresponding CUUP5qi.profile5qi value. The CUUP5qi.dscp attribute is set to the preferred DSCP value.
    2. Each 5QI is mapped to a DSCP value with the CUUP5qi.dscp attribute for the valid slice mapping.
3. If no operator-defined, slice-specific QoS mapping is configured, the gNodeB checks if an operator-defined default QoS mapping is configured. This is done by checking if the CUUP5qiTable.default5qiTable attribute is set to true.
    1. The gNodeB checks if the matching QoS profile for the 5QI exists. The matching QoS profile for the 5QI exists if the following conditions are met: The CUUP5qiTable.default5qiTable attribute is set to true. The 5QI is set to the corresponding CUUP5qi.profile5qi value. The CUUP5qi.dscp attribute is set to the preferred DSCP value.
    2. Each 5QI is mapped to a DSCP value with the CUUP5qi.dscp attribute for the default mapping.
4. If no operator-defined default QoS mapping is configured, each 5QI is mapped to a predefined DSCP value recommended in the CUUP5qi.dscp attribute. For more information on predefined DSCP values, see E2E QoS Guideline.
5. The selected DSCP value is set for the corresponding outgoing IP packets to the UPF.

## 3.2 DSCP Mapping Based on QCI

DSCP values based on QCIs can be mapped to the transport network QoS in the S1 Secondary

Node terminated DRB to either the SGW or the Master Node (eNodeB).

The mapping of DSCP values based on QCIs in the S1 Secondary Node terminated DRB to the

SGW or the Master Node (eNodeB) can be configured through the

CUUP5qi.dscp attribute. Each QCI is directly mapped to a 5QI,

that is, the QCI value is equivalent to the 5QI value.

The Master Node (eNodeB) sends the following messages to the Secondary Node (gNodeB),

containing the QCI:

- X2AP: SGNB ADDITION REQUEST
- X2AP: SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST

Operational Process

Figure 2   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The Secondary Node (gNodeB) receives an incoming E-RAB setup request from the Master Node. The message contains QoS parameters, including QCI.
2. The Secondary Node (gNodeB) checks if an operator-defined default QoS mapping is configured. Default QoS mapping is configured if the CUUP5qiTable.default5qiTable attribute is set to true.
    1. The Secondary Node (gNodeB) checks if the matching QoS profile for the QCI exists. The matching QoS profile for the QCI exists if the following conditions are met: The CUUP5qiTable.default5qiTable attribute is set to true. The QCI is set to the corresponding CUUP5qi.profile5qi value. The CUUP5qi.dscp attribute is set to the preferred DSCP value.
    2. Each QCI is mapped to a DSCP value with the CUUP5qi.dscp attribute for the default mapping.
3. If no operator-defined default QoS mapping is configured, each QCI is mapped to a predefined DSCP value recommended in the CUUP5qi.dscp attribute. For more information on predefined DSCP values, see E2E QoS Guideline.
4. The selected DSCP value is set for the corresponding outgoing IP packets to either the Master Node (eNodeB) or the SGW.

If the CUUP5qiTable.default5qiTable attribute is                                 set to true, the following applies:  Slice-specific QoS is not used and a default QoS is                                             configured.

# 6 Performance of NR DSCP Mapping Based on 5QI and QCI

The feature does not affect KPIs and it does not introduce counters or

events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for NR DSCP Mapping Based on 5QI and QCI

It is possible to configure the DSCP mapping for slice-specific QoS or regardless of

network slice configuration.

## 8.1 Configure Slice-Specific DSCP Mapping

It is possible to configure the DSCP mapping for a specific network slice. For

detailed information on QoS-related design guidelines and 5G network slicing, see

E2E QoS Guideline and NR SA Network Slicing Guideline.

Steps

1. Create the following MO instances if they do not exist: CUUP5qiTable CUUP5qi ResourcePartition ResourcePartitionMember
2. Set the CUUP5qiTable.default5qiTable attribute to false.
3. Set the 5QI to the corresponding CUUP5qi.profile5qi value.
4. Set the CUUP5qi.dscp attribute to the preferred DSCP value.
5. Set the ResourcePartitionMember.pLMNIDList attribute to the corresponding PLMN ID value.
6. Set the ResourcePartitionMember.sNSSAIList attribute to the corresponding S-NSSAI value.
7. Set the ResourcePartition.related5qiTableRef attribute to refer to the CUUP5qiTable MO instance.

Results

The value of the CUUP5qi.dscp attribute is automatically mapped to

the transport network QoS for the S-NSSAI.

## 8.2 Configure DSCP Mapping Regardless of Network Slice Configuration

It is possible to set a default QoS regardless of network slice configuration. For

detailed information on QoS-related design guidelines, see E2E QoS Guideline.

Steps

1. Create the CUUP5qiTable and CUUP5qi MO instances if they do not exist.
2. Set the CUUP5qiTable.default5qiTable attribute to true.
3. Set the 5QI or QCI to the corresponding CUUP5qi.profile5qi value.
4. Set the CUUP5qi.dscp attribute to the preferred DSCP value.

Results

The value of the CUUP5qi.dscp attribute is automatically mapped to

the transport network QoS.
