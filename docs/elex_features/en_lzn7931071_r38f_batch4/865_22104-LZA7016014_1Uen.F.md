Hardware

This feature is supported on the Baseband units in RAN Compute group 4,

5 and

6.

Limitations

This feature has the following limitations:

- Quality of Service (QoS) The following functions are not available for hardware-switched flows: Ingress QoS remarking through PcpPcpMap MO Ingress QoS remarking through DscpDscpMap MO Egress QoS remarking through DscpPcpMap MO Egress QoS remarking through DscpToPCPMap MO Queue functions represented by following MOs under QueueSystem MO: QueueRed QueueTailDrop QoSClassifier SchedulerDwrr SchedulerSp Shaper
- The following PM counters do not include the low latency switching traffic: EthernetPort.ifHCInUcastPkts EthernetPort.ifHCOutUcastPkts EthernetPort.ifHCOutMulticastPkts VlanPort.ifHCInOctets VlanPort.ifHCInUcastPkts VlanPort.ifHCOutOctets VlanPort.ifHCOutMulticastPkts VlanPort.ifHCOutUcastPkts
- In case of TN port sharing on a node with Elastic RAN flows or generally higher PCP (6,7) marked hardware-switched flows, there is a possibility of slightly increased latency for originated traffic on that node, egressing from the given TN port.
- Limitations with the PM counters related to the VlanPort and the EthernetPort MO might lead to challenges with troubleshooting.
- When a LagPort MO is shared between hardware switching and other configurations, such as software forwarding and software originated, LAG hashing performs differently for the two cases. This might lead to suboptimal distribution of flows across LAG member ports. Additionally, in case of configuration change from or to software-based switching and hardware-based switching, different flow distribution might be observed on the LAG member ports.
- When the Port Mirroring functionality is configured in egress direction for hardware switched traffic, the mirrored egress traffic carries the VLAN tag from the original source VlanPort MO, not from the egress VlanPort MO.
- For an EthernetPort or VlanPort participating in hardware-based switching, a L2 Packet Capture operation on these ports does not capture any hardware switched flows.

Network Requirements

(1)

1. It is supported to have a VlanPort member with the VlanPort.isTagged attribute set to false in the low latency switching based on Bridge instance.
2. One existing schematron rule for VlanPort MO is that if reserved by the ENodeBFunction, ExternalENodeBFunction,GNBDUFunction, ExternalGNodeBFunction, ExtGNBDUPartnerFunction, FgwService or FgwTermPoint MO type, this port can only be reserved by the PtpBcOcPort, GNBDUFunction or ExtGNBDUPartnerFunction MO type. This rule blocks use of VlanPort MOs reserved by other applications, for any Bridge instance, including low latency switching based on Bridge MOs.

The following PM counters do not include the low latency switching traffic:

- EthernetPort.ifHCInUcastPkts
- EthernetPort.ifHCOutUcastPkts
- EthernetPort.ifHCOutMulticastPkts
- VlanPort.ifHCInOctets
- VlanPort.ifHCInUcastPkts

- VlanPort.ifHCOutMulticastPkts

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Hardware-Based Switching for Site Connectivity

The Bridge.lowLatencySwitching attribute needs to be set to

true on a Bridge MO instance, to enable the

functionality. The Bridge MO instance can have zero or more

VlanPort members when setting the attribute. It means

VlanPort MOs can be added to a Bridge MO

before or after setting the Bridge.lowLatencySwitching attribute.

Figure 1 shows an example of the configuration of

low latency bridge.

Operational Process

Figure 1   Low Latency Bridge Configuration

1. Create a Bridge MO instance.
2. Set the Bridge.lowLatencySwitching attribute to true.
3. Create a needed number of VlanPort MO instances.
4. Set the Bridge.port attribute to refer to the previously created VlanPort MOs.
