Summary

The feature supports configuring mixed bandwidths for uplink and downlink CA for NR sector

carriers that belong to the same SectorEquipmentFunction MO. This

enables the operator to use a more scattered spectrum, which can increase throughput

and efficiency in the system.

It is recommended to set the bandwidth for the carrier of the PSCell to the highest possible

value.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Mixed Bandwidth Support for Carrier Aggregation High-Band

The feature allows the operator to use a combination of bandwidths for carrier

aggregation (CA). As a result, higher peak throughput can be achieved.

The configuration and system behavior follow uplink and downlink CA. For more

information, see the following documents:

- NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation High-Band
- NR 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation High-Band
- NR 8CC DL Carrier Aggregation High-Band

When using mixed bandwidth, for the best capacity and performance, it is recommended to

configure the PSCell on the carrier with the highest available bandwidth.

When selecting the supported band combinations, the following limitations must be

considered:

- The maximum spread in frequency for the selected band combination can be limited by the operational bandwidth of the radio.
- The band combinations can be limited by how the combination can be placed on the PAAM segments.

Example 1

Contiguous band combinations can be configured

to form a non-contiguous band combination set on a radio type with two PAAM segments

as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1   Band Combinations Supported for PAAM Segments

In this example, band combination 2 must be allocated so that it occupies parts

of two PAAM segments. The distance between PAAM 1 and PAAM 2 must not exceed the

maximum frequency spread for contiguous band combination sets defined in 3GPP

TS 38.101-2. The reason for this is that the combined bandwidth and

necessary spacing for band combinations 1 and 2 exceeds the bandwidth for one PAAM

segment.

The following distance values cannot be less than the minimum

frequency spread between contiguous band combination sets specified in 3GPP TS

38.101-2:

- The distance between band combinations 1 and 2
- The distance between band combinations 2 and 3

If possible, it is recommended to use the available spectrum so that no

band combinations are allocated to both PAAM segments. In Figure 1, if band combination 3 is allocated

in PAAM 1, and band combination 2 is allocated in PAAM 2, the two PAAM segments have

different frequencies, and a more scattered spectrum can be used.
