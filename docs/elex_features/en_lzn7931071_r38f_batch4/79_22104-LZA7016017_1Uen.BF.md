Summary

The High Speed UE Low/Mid-Band feature provides the following benefits for UEs that are

traveling at speeds above 100 km/h:

- Satisfactory throughput
- Robust connection
- Improved accessibility

This is achieved by adding cell-level functions on the following channels:

- PRACH
- PUCCH
- PUSCH
- PDSCH

The feature supports NR SA deployments and EN-DC

deployments.

The feature can automatically configure additional DMRS symbols on the PUSCH and PDSCH

separately, depending on the configured maximum UE speed and the carrier frequency.

This configuration can benefit from UE demodulation to resist Doppler spread.

The feature also supports the enhanced detection method for PRACH format B4 and PUCCH

to resist large frequency offsets.

The feature can automatically configure PRACH format 0 or PRACH format 1 as one of the

following set types:

- Unrestricted set
- Restricted set Type A
- Restricted set Type B

The PRACH format can be manually configured with the

NRCellDU.rachPreambleFormat attribute, if the feature is

activated.

The NRCellDU.typeISinglePanelRiRestriction attribute enables the

limitation of the maximum number of downlink PDSCH transmission layers to two for

better performance in the following environments:

- Urban macro
- Suburban
- Rural macro

The limitation of the number of downlink PDSCH transmission layers is not

required in urban micro environments.

Limitations

No known

limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of High Speed UE Low/Mid-Band

The feature facilitates increased UE traveling speed. It

includes the configuration of additional DMRS symbols and is also capable of estimating and

compensating frequency offsets.

The

feature extends the uplink frequency offset estimation and compensation range on the

PUSCH, PUCCH, and PRACH. This results in a robust connection for UEs moving at up to 500

km/h speed. The feature also uses additional DMRS symbols on the PDSCH for higher

downlink throughput when time variations are fast in the channel.

Operational Process

The feature can be configured in each cell by setting the

NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed attribute. The PRACH format can be

manually configured with the NRCellDU.rachPreambleFormat

attribute, if the feature is activated. One or two additional DMRS symbols can be

automatically configured for the PDSCH and the PUSCH separately, to counteract fast

time variations in the

channel.

The

feature implements the following functions:

- Cell-level configuration of one or two additional DMRS symbols This configuration on the PUSCH depends on the NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed attribute and the carrier frequency point. The uplink frequency offset estimation range can be extended with two additional DMRS symbols.
- PRACH format B4 capability for supporting large frequency offsets that correspond to 500 km/h and 3.9 GHz carrier frequency.
- Automatic configuration of PRACH format 0 or PRACH format 1 as one the following set types: Unrestricted set Restricted set Type A Restricted set Type B Note: The used set type depends on the following factors: Configured maximum UE speed, defined by the NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed attribute Configured cell range, defined by the NRCellDU.cellRange attribute Carrier frequency, defined by the NR ARFCN

The improved PRACH format

B4 detection and the restricted set of PRACH format 0 or PRACH format 1 can increase

the success rate of the following procedures:

- Random access
- EN-DC Setup
- EN-DC Intra-gNodeB PSCell Change
- NR SA Setup
- NR SA intra-NR Handover

The NRCellDU.typeISinglePanelRiRestriction attribute enables the

limitation of the maximum number of downlink PDSCH transmission layers to two for

better performance in the following environments:

- Urban macro
- Suburban
- Rural macro

The limitation of the number of downlink PDSCH transmission layers is not

required in urban micro environments.

The feature uses attributes in the NRCellCU and in the

EUtranFreqRelation MO classes to support mobility state

management and cell reselection. The following types of cell reselection can be

configured:

- Intra-frequency
- Inter-frequency
- IRAT

The measurements for cell reselection are transmitted in SIBs.

SIBs must be sent to the UEs to enable cell reselection with configured scaling

factors. The cells are affected by the updated frequency relation and the relevant

SIBs are rebuilt for all unlocked cells that are affected.

The feature can operate with downlink carrier aggregation in EN-DC and NR

SA.

The NRCellDU.typeISinglePanelRiRestriction and

NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed attributes can be set to different values

for the PCell and SCell.

# 4 Network Impact of High Speed UE Low/Mid-Band

The feature increases performance in terms of related network functions in high-speed

areas.

Capacity and Performance

The feature improves the performance of the following network functions in high-speed

areas:

- Cell throughput
- UE throughput
- The retainability of the SCG radio resources for EN-DC
- The DRB retainability for NR SA
- Random access success rate
- EN-DC setup success rate
- NR SA handover success rate

However, the feature cannot ensure maximum cell capacity when two additional

DMRS symbols are configured for the cell in high-speed areas.

The configuration of two additional DMRS symbols enables the PUSCH receiver to extend

the frequency estimation range.

The feature cannot ensure a robust connection and accessibility if the uplink

frequency offset is out of the frequency estimation range. Therefore, the

performance can decrease if the UE speed and the carrier frequency are higher than

the values in Table 4.

The feature cannot ensure the accessibility success rate if the uplink frequency

offset is above 3,100 Hz and PRACH format 0 or PRACH format 1 is configured.

Therefore, PRACH detection issues can occur when the UE speed is above 370 km/h and

the carrier frequency is above 3.9 GHz considering a UE carrier

frequency error of ±0.1 ppm.

The feature can decrease the Baseband uplink peak throughput capacity for radios with

the following characteristics:

- 8TX/8RX antenna port configuration
- NR TDD CPRI
- NR FDD CPRI
- TDD patterns with multiple consecutive uplink slots

Interfaces

No

impact.

Other Network Elements

The feature requires an EN-DC-capable or NR standalone-capable UE to operate. The UE

must support up to 500-km/h speed in the cell. In addition, the transmission of MCG

radio resources also requires up to 500-km/h speed support in LTE coverage.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for High Speed UE Low/Mid-Band

## 8.1 Configure Maximum UE Speed

The maximum speed of the UE can be configured by setting the

NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed attribute.

Steps

1. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
2. Set the NRCellDU.maxUeSpeed attribute to one of the following values depending on the speed of the UE: UP\_TO\_200KMPH for UEs that move at a speed up to 200 km/h UP\_TO\_350KMPH for UEs that move at a speed up to 350 km/h UP\_TO\_500KMPH for UEs that move at a speed up to 500 km/h
3. Set the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

## 8.2 Configure Maximum Number of Layers in the Downlink

The maximum number of layers allowed in the downlink can be configured by setting the

NRCellDU.typeISinglePanelRiRestriction attribute.

Steps

The NRCellDU.typeISinglePanelRiRestriction attribute takes

effect on new connections without locking and unlocking the cell.

1. Set the NRCellDU.typeISinglePanelRiRestriction attribute to b00000011 to configure up to two downlink layers for this feature.

## 8.3 Configure Connected Mode DRX for High Speed UE Low/Mid-Band

The High Speed UE Low/Mid-Band feature requires a feature-specific configuration of

the Connected Mode DRX feature.

The length of the Connected Mode DRX-related periods must be configured in the

DrxProfileUeCfg MO class for UE groups with standard

traffic.

Steps

1. Configure the long DRX cycle by setting the DrxProfileUeCfg.drxLongCycle attribute to 80 ms.
2. Configure the On Duration period by setting the DrxProfileUeCfg.drxOnDurationTimer attribute to 10 ms.
3. Configure the inactivity timer period by setting the DrxProfileUeCfg.drxInactivityTimer attribute to 60 ms.

## 8.4 Cell Range Configuration for High Speed UE Low/Mid-Band

The feature enables the configuration of cell range settings to define the number of

RACH root sequences in each cell.

The PRACH preamble format can be configured for CPRI and eCPRI with the

NRCellDU.rachPreambleFormat attribute. The configured set type

can be checked with the NRCellDU.rachRestrictedSetConfig

attribute.

The NRCellDU.rachRootSequence

attribute configures the value of the first prach-RootSequenceIndex

for RACH in the cell. PRACH resources overlap in the network. It is recommended to

set the NRCellDU.rachRootSequence attribute to different values

in neighboring cells to reduce the probability of false RACH detections. Different

preambles can be defined for different cells with the

NRCellDU.rachPreambleFormat attribute.

The number of required RACH root sequences in each cell

depends on the cell range. The NRCellDU.cellRange attribute sets

the cell range.

NCS is the cyclic shift value used for the random access preamble generation

and controlled by the zeroCorrelationZoneConfig attribute. The

appropriate value of zeroCorrelationZoneConfig is selected

automatically for the configured cell range. For more information, see Section 6.3.3 in

3GPP TS 38.211 version 16.6.0.

For the cell range and number of RACH root sequences for the unrestricted set, see NR Standalone and Random Access EN-DC.
