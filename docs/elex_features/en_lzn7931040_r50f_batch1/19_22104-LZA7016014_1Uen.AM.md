Summary

The TMA is powered by the RBS. TMAs compliant with the 3GPP Iuant standard can be supervised

by the RBS. Without this feature, the TMA cannot be powered by the RBS and no TMA

supervision is possible.

The TMA Support feature is supported by AISG 3.0.

Additional Information

For more information, see the following documentation:

- Manage Hardware Equipment
- 3GPP TS 25.460
- 3GPP TS 25.461
- 3GPP TS 25.462
- 3GPP TS 25.466
- 3GPP TS 32.642

# 2 Dependencies of TMA Support

There are no dependencies to other

features.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

Communication support for TMA units with proprietary interfaces is not provided.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of TMA Support

The 3GPP compatible TMA is installed on an antenna tower, connected directly to the

antenna feeder cable. The TMA is used to compensate for feeder loss on the uplink, allowing

antennas to be placed with some distance from the RBS.

The feature complies to the 3GPP specification TS 25.466.

The TMA amplifies radio frequency signals received by the antenna before they are sent to the

RBS across the antenna feeder cables. The resulting improvement in SNR minimizes the

detrimental effect of the feeder cable loss and improves uplink coverage. The TMA

specifications match the operating band and frequency of the sector. TMAs are connected close

to the antenna, directly to the antenna jumper cable.

Figure 1   TMA Installed on Antenna Tower

This feature enables the RBS to supply DC power to the TMA through the antenna feeder cable.

The feature also enables RBS support for the Iuant protocol for TMAs, allowing communication

with 3GPP Iuant (AISG v2) compliant TMAs. The antenna feeder cable is used to carry the Iuant

signaling between the TMA and RBS. The Iuant interface is used to provide TMA supervision,

such as TMA fault reporting.

Communication support for TMA units with proprietary interfaces

is not provided.

Power Consumption

Table 1   Maximum TMA Power Consumption According to the 3GPP Iuant Standard, 3GPP TS

25.461

| Unit   | Power Consumption   |
|--------|---------------------|
| TMA    | 7.5 W(1)            |

(1)

Startup power consumption can be higher.

# 4 Network Impact of TMA Support

The feature can have a positive effect on coverage.

Capacity and Performance

In areas where low uplink signal strength limits the cell range, the improved receiving

sensitivity can improve coverage or decrease the number of sites required for coverage.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for TMA Support

Configuration parameters are introduced for this feature.

# 6 Performance of TMA Support

The feature is part of LTE Basic and has no directly associated KPIs, counters, and

events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines

TMA Support can be configured and supervised by the Network Management System. Faults

can be indicated by the 3GPP/Iuant unit handled by the system and reported through the Network

Management System.

The parameters in the AntennaNearUnit and TmaSubUnit

MOs are visible in the Network Management System. The TMA has internal supervision.

The software in the TMA can be remotely upgraded as described in Firmware Download of Antenna Line Devices.
