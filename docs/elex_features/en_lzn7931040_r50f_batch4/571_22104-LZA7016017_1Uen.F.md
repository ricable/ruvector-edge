Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

This feature requires a standalone iPerf3 server or an iPerf3 server hosted by a

network element. The performance of the network is measured between the RBS and

another network location chosen by the operator. Because of this, the iPerf3 server

must be located at that network location.

The recommended server iperf3 version is 3.10.1.

The maximum socket receive buffer size of the server must be at least 2 MB.

For a Linux-based server, the buffer size can be checked and modified in the file

system without reboot. The command sysctl net.core.rmem\_max

prints the current value of the variable, and the command sysctl -w

net.core.rmem\_max=2097152 sets the variable to 2 MB.

# 3 Feature Operation of Backhaul Turn Up Testing

This feature performs a throughput measurement between the RBS and an iPerf3 server to

provide information about the throughput to the RBS and from the RBS. The measurement is

triggered by running the ranperf Ericsson CLI command.

This feature supports up to four measurements simultaneously. Each measurement is started

from a different shell with a unique destination, which is identified by server IP

address and UDP port.

The

measurement result is printed directly in the shell.

With this feature, the process of an RBS installation has the

following

steps:

1. Installing the upgrade package
2. Locking cells to prohibit traffic
3. Verifying that the backhaul can handle the required uplink throughput from the RBS by initiating between one or more measurements
4. Verifying that the backhaul can handle the required downlink throughput to the RBS by initiating between one or more measurements
5. Unlocking cells to enable traffic

It

is up to the operator to interpret the results of the measurements. As long as the

normal loss ratio requirements on the network have been fulfilled, some recorded packet

losses in the throughput measurements might be acceptable.

For a given packet length, the feature can only properly handle bitrates up to a certain

level. Higher bitrates lead to packet losses that are internal to the feature itself and

not caused by network limitations.

Table 2

shows the maximum bitrates measured for various packet lengths, given as the size of the

UDP data field in the test packets. Normal mode corresponds to uplink testing, reverse

mode corresponds to downlink testing. The figures are based on the assumption of a

single measurement at a time.

When

configuring length as shown in the table, no higher bitrates than shown can be measured.

However, it may be possible to increase the figures by running more than one measurement

simultaneously.

Table 2   Maximum Measured Bitrates for Packet Lengths

|   Length | Mode    | Bitrate                                        |
|----------|---------|------------------------------------------------|
|     1352 | normal  | 1.8                                 Gbits/sec  |
|     1352 | reverse | 2.8                                 Gbits/sec  |
|      800 | normal  | 1.05                                 Gbits/sec |
|      800 | reverse | 1.7                                 Gbits/sec  |
|      200 | normal  | 280                                 Mbits/sec  |
|      200 | reverse | 430                                 Mbits/sec  |
|       50 | normal  | 80                                 Mbits/sec   |

# 4 Network Impact of Backhaul Turn Up Testing

This feature might

affect

RBS performance and network

throughput.

Capacity and Performance

If this feature is used after the RBS is put into service, the traffic might be

disrupted until the throughput measurement is completed. To avoid network impact, it

is recommended to use this feature before the RBS is put into service.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No

impact.

# 5 Parameters for Backhaul Turn Up Testing

This feature has no parameter

impact.

# 6 Performance of Backhaul Turn Up Testing

This feature has no performance impact.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
