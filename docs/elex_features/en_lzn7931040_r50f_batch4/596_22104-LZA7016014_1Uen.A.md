Summary

This feature enables the configuration of an 8.8 MHz channel bandwidth in LTE by blocking PRBs

at the edges of a 10-MHz channel bandwidth spectrum. Blocked PRBs cannot be used by

the LTE channel. By reducing the spectrum allocated to LTE, a wider spectrum becomes

available for other RATs.

This feature has two configurations:

| Low Edge Configuration   |    | PRBs at the low edge of the channel bandwidth are used, only high 								edge PRBs are blocked.   |
|--------------------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                          |    |                                                                                                    |
| High Edge Configuration  |    | PRBs at the high edge of the channel bandwidth are used, only low 								edge PRBs are blocked.   |

Hardware

The feature is supported on Radio 2271 B0C.

Limitations

The feature does not support TDD.

If the feature is used in low edge configuration, the total channel bandwidth is 8.4

MHz.

The feature has the following limitations for NB-IoT deployed in the cell:

- Power boost for non-blocked PRBs in the channel is disabled.Note: The value of the EUtranCellFDD.dlCchAndRefSigBoost attribute can only be set to FALSE.
- NB-IoT in-band and guard band mode can only be configured on PRBs that are not blocked.
- Category M1 access is not supported.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE 8.8 MHz Channel Bandwidth

The feature uses attributes to provide

a wider bandwidth for other RATs by blocking PRBs in the LTE channel bandwidth. PRBs are

blocked at the low edge or the high edge of the channel, depending on the feature

configuration.

The feature reduces channel bandwidth by blocking PRBs at the edges of an LTE channel.

Blocked PRBs can be used by other RATs. It is recommended to block the same number of

PRBs on both uplink and downlink. The feature supports asymmetric PRB blocking between

uplink and downlink. PRBs can be blocked at the high or at the low edge of the channel,

depending on the feature configuration.

The feature has two configurations:

| Low Edge Configuration   |    | PRBs at the low edge of the channel bandwidth are used, only high edge                             PRBs are blocked. If the feature is used in low edge configuration, the                             total channel bandwidth is 8.4 MHz.   |
|--------------------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                          |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| High Edge Configuration  |    | PRBs at the high edge of the channel bandwidth are used, only low edge                             PRBs are blocked. If the feature is used in high edge configuration, the                             total channel bandwidth is 8.8 MHz.  |

The EutranCellFDD.dlInternalChannelFreqBias and the

EutranCellFDD.ulInternalChannelFreqBias attributes can be used to

select between low edge and high edge configuration.

The EutranCellFDD.dlChannelBandwidth and the

EutranCellFDD.ulChannelBandwidth attributes can be used to

configure channel bandwidth to 10 MHz. The

EutranCellFDD.dlInternalChannelBandwidth and the

EutranCellFDD.ulInternalChannelBandwidth attributes can be used

to limit the configured 10-MHz channel bandwidth to 8.8 MHz.

The EUtranCellFDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion attribute controls

the total number of PDSCH scheduling PRBs. The

EUtranCellFDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart attribute controls the

number of the PRBs not scheduling PDSCH on the low edge of the channel.

The EUtranCellFDD.ulFrequencyAllocationProportion attribute controls

the total number of PUSCH scheduling PRBs. The

EUtranCellFDD.ulConfigurableFrequencyStart attribute controls the

number of the PRBs not scheduling PUSCH on the low edge of the channel.

The EUtranCellFDD.dlCchAndRefSigBlockActive attribute controls the

muting of blocked PRBs. The EUtranCellFDD.dlCchAndRefSigBoost

attribute controls the power boost for non-blocked PRBs in the channel.

The EUtranCellFDD.pucchOverdimensioning attribute ensures that PUCCH

is allocated on PRBs within the wanted channel bandwidth.

# 6 Performance of LTE 8.8 MHz Channel Bandwidth

The feature has no related KPIs, counters, or events.

Key Performance Indicators

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for LTE 8.8 MHz Channel Bandwidth

The LTE 8.8 MHz Channel Bandwidth feature has two configurations:

| Low Edge Configuration   |    | PRBs at the low edge of the channel bandwidth are used, only high edge                             PRBs are blocked. If the feature is used in low-edge configurations, the                             total channel bandwidth is 8.4 MHz.   |
|--------------------------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                          |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| High Edge Configuration  |    | PRBs at the high edge of the channel bandwidth are used, only low edge                             PRBs are blocked. If the feature is used in high-edge configurations,                             the total channel bandwidth is 8.8 MHz.  |

## 8.1 Enable Low-Edge Configuration for LTE 8.8 MHz Channel Bandwidth

Low-edge configurations can be enabled by setting the relevant attributes to

appropriate values.

The low-edge configuration blocks PRBs at the high edge of the cell and creates

8.4-MHz total channel bandwidth.

Prerequisites

- The Flexible Channel Bandwidth feature is enabled.
- If the PUCCH Overdimensioning feature is used, the relevant license key must be installed on the node.

Steps

1. Set the value of the EutranCellFDD.dlChannelBandwidth and the EutranCellFDD.ulChannelBandwidth attributes to 10000.
2. Set the value of the EutranCellFDD.dlInternalChannelBandwidth and the EutranCellFDD.ulInternalChannelBandwidth attributes to 8800.

## 8.2 Enable High-Edge Configuration for LTE 8.8 MHz Channel Bandwidth

High-edge configurations can be enabled by setting the relevant attributes to

appropriate values.

The high-edge configuration blocks PRBs at the low edge of the cell and creates

8.8-MHz total channel bandwidth.

Prerequisites

- The Flexible Channel Bandwidth feature is enabled.
- If the PUCCH Overdimensioning feature is used, the relevant license key must be installed on the node.

Steps

1. Set the value of the EutranCellFDD.dlChannelBandwidth and the EutranCellFDD.ulChannelBandwidth attributes to 10000.
2. Set the value of the EutranCellFDD.dlInternalChannelBandwidth and the EutranCellFDD.ulInternalChannelBandwidth attributes to 8800.
3. Set the value of the EutranCellFDD.dlInternalChannelFreqBias and the EutranCellFDD.ulInternalChannelFreqBias attributes to FBT\_UPPER.
4. Lock the EUranCellFDD MO.
5. Disable interference management by setting the value of the EUtranCellFDD.dlInterferenceManagementActive and the EUtranCellFDD.ulInterferenceManagementActive attributes to FALSE.
6. Set the value of the EUtranCellFDD.dlFrequencyAllocationProportion and the EUtranCellFDD.ulFrequencyAllocationProportion attributes to 88.
7. Set the value of the EUtranCellFDD.dlConfigurableFrequencyStart and the EUtranCellFDD.ulConfigurableFrequencyStart attributes to 13.
8. Set the value of the EutranCellFDD.dlCchAndRefSigBlockActive attribute to TRUE.
9. Set the value of the EutranCellFDD.dlCchAndRefSigBoost attribute to TRUE. Note: If NB-IoT is deployed in the cell, the value of this attribute can only be set to FALSE.
