Summary

The feature supervises that batteries are sufficiently recharged after a discharge. It also

detects battery backup problems caused by one of the following issues:

- Faulty battery
- Insufficient PSU capacity
- Unreliable mains power supply

The feature is based on a test cycle during which the PSU output voltage is temporarily

lowered so that the RBS runs on battery power.

The test can be performed on shared and non-shared batteries. For shared battery

configurations, the test evaluates the backup time. For non-shared batteries, the

test evaluates the following battery values:

- Backup time
- Battery capacity
- State-of-health

For more information on how to perform a battery test, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

Results from all battery tests are stored in a battery log. Old or faulty batteries

are identified by the system and the operator can plan ahead for battery change or

maintenance work.

For more information about the battery log, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

# 2 Dependencies of Battery Test

The feature has no dependencies to other features and functions.

Feature Dependencies

No dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Battery Test

The feature allows continuous monitoring of the battery condition. It also enables to

change the batteries when needed instead of periodically.

Battery Test Mode

The test mode value provides information about the schedule of the battery tests.

Battery tests can be set to automatic mode or to configured mode through the

BatteryBackup.testMode attribute.

False Alarms Caused by the Battery Test

The battery test function can raise false alarms. If a node contains equipment that is

monitoring the supplied voltage (not PSUs or BFUs), alarms can be raised because of the low

voltage. The supplied voltage is lower in the cabinet when the battery tests are run. To

prevent this behavior, deactivate the battery test function for these nodes, by setting the

BatteryBackup.testMode attribute to DISABLED.

Shared Battery Configuration Impact

In a shared battery configuration, two or more RBSs are connected in parallel to one pooled

battery bank in one or more BBS or BBU cabinets. The BBS or BBU cabinets can also have a CLU

or other equipment powered from the RBS PDU interface. From a functionality perspective,

this kind of BBS or BBU are the same as a shared battery configuration.

The use of shared batteries impacts the behavior of the battery test function and does not

allow more advanced functionality, for example battery capacity evaluation.

Battery Test Scenarios

Battery tests can be initiated in different scenarios.
