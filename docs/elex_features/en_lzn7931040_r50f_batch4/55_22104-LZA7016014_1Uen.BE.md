# 1 Connected Users Overview

The capacity defines the maximum number of connected users on the specified RBS based

on operator preferences.

Summary

The operator can restrict the maximum amount of simultaneous connected users to optimize

financial models and pay as the traffic grows. As more users load the network, the Connected

Users license can be increased to support the increased traffic.

Additional Information

More information about this capacity and related topics can be found in the following

documentation:

- Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and Massive IoT RAN

# 2 Dependencies of Connected Users

The capacity has no dependencies.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Connected Users

The capacity defines the maximum number of connected users on the specified

RBS.

The Connected Users capacity secures sufficient RBS capabilities to serve the given traffic

of simultaneous connected users.

A license restricts RBS capacity for the maximum allowed simultaneous connected users. A

connected user is defined as UE in the 3GPP-defined state RRC\_CONNECTED.

Through the appropriate observability for the capacity licenses,

the system helps the operator to optimize the use of licenses for

each RBS in the network.

The maximum range for the number of simultaneous connected users depends on the baseband

hardware.

The Connected Users capacity license can be applied at the following

three levels:

- Priced level - Existing and supported handling.
- Boundary level - The Connected Users capacity is restricted at a boundary level defined in the contract.
- Not Contractually Limited (NCL) level - No finite capacity is defined in the contract, which means the Connected Users capacity restriction is disabled.

If the license capacity is changed, and the new value is lower than the old license pool, no

UE is forced to disconnect. However, no UE is admitted until the new license limit is

reached.

If an emergency state is enabled, the hard limit acts as license limit for connected users.

When the emergency state is changed, the license limit is also changed.

# 4 Network Impact of Connected Users

The capacity has no network impact.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

Events

# 7 Enable or Disable Capacity

While license-controlled features need to be individually activated, capacities are

automatically enabled when the License Key File is installed on a node. Capacity cannot

be deactivated once it is enabled on the node.

# 8 Install License Key File on Baseband Products

Prerequisites

- The LKF is available for installation. The path to the LKF is defined in the RBS Summary File, as described in Manage Configuration Files.
- The date and time settings of the system clock in the node are correct. If the settings are incorrect, the LKF can be rejected by the node during installation.
- The fingerprint of the node is configured. The fingerprint is permanent, and it cannot be changed after the first successful installation of the LKF. The fingerprint in the LKF must match the fingerprint of the node. If the fingerprints do not match, the LKF is rejected.
- No other LKF installations are ongoing on the node.
- If the LKF is stored on an SFTP server, the password is required to access the server.
- The fail-safe backup function is activated. Some licenses or HWACs can cause O&amp;M connectivity failure, if their respective license key or HWAC key is missing from the LKF. If the fail-safe backup function is activated, the system can recover from the failure. The system performs the automatic restore from a backup, if the configuration is not confirmed within the predefined rollback period. For more information, see Manage Software.
- When the node runs in power saving mode,the capacity supported by the power saving mode can be exceeded if more HWAC capacity is required. For more information on Baseband Power Savings, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

Steps

1. Run the installKeyFile (&lt;uri&gt;, &lt;password&gt;) action in the KeyFileManagement MO to start the installation. The URI specifies the location where the LKF is stored. The password parameter is required to access the location specified in the URI. The password parameter must always be provided, even if it is not a requirement to provide a password for the specified location. The progress of the installation can be monitored through the KeyFileManagement.reportProgress attribute.
2. Check the result in the KeyFileManagement.reportProgress attribute.

If the parameter is FAILURE, do the following:

3. Read and evaluate the resultInfo field of the KeyFileManagement.reportProgress attribute.

If the parameter is SUCCESS, do the following:

4. If needed, check that the correct LKF is installed by reading the KeyFileInformation.sequenceNumber MO.

Results

The Lm MO updates its MO structure to reflect the new LKF

information. For each entry in the LKF, the following changes are implemented:

- For every optional feature, FeatureState and FeatureKey are created. FeatureState.keyId and FeatureKey.keyId receive the value of the featureKey id from the LKF.
- For every capacity, CapacityState and CapacityKey are created. CapacityState.keyId and CapacityKey.keyId receive the value of the capacityKey id from the LKF.

The FeatureState.licenseState and

CapacityState.licenseState attribute becomes

ENABLED for each license key or HWAC key in the installed

LKF.

After This Task

Deactivate the fail-safe backup function.
