# 3 Feature Operation of Efficient Fault Management

Efficient Fault Management provides mechanisms to enhance the monitoring

capabilities.

The aim of the feature is to provide efficient identification and mitigation of faults

with focus on the following areas:

| Observability of system recoverable faults   |    | The observability of system recoverable faults is improved through                         notifications which give insights into self-healing activities. For                             example:  alerts notifying that the cell is temporarily disabled (due to                                     recovery actions initiated) or enabled (when the recovery is                                     successful).                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                              |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Optimization of alarm notifications          |    | If the node is not able to recover a service, the user is provided with                         accurate information assuring that the fault is reported once and                         pinpointing the root cause. For example:  suppression of power-related alarm storms,     reduced number of alarm notifications through configurable                                     external alarm port filters.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|                                              |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Customization of notifications               |    | The function allows configuring the network supervision according to the                         preferences of the operator. For example:  filtering of alarm and alert notifications defined by the                                     user.      The operator can filter notification of alarms and alerts sent from the                         Baseband Radio Node by setting certain criteria that decides if the                         notification is sent or suppressed. This can increase the relevance of the                         notifications and reduce the number of alarms and alerts sent to ENM. |

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 21.Q3: Improved S1 Alarm Handling

A new PLMN Service Redundancy Lost alarm is introduced to notify the user when the S1

link redundancy is lost for a given PLMN.

| Feature Name:           | Efficient Fault Management   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5338                 |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package             |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400                 |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node          |
| Access Type:            | LTE                          |

Benefits

With the PLMN Service Redundancy Lost alarm introduced, users can

maintain the node or network more efficiently when the redundancy for S1 is lost.

For example, the Support Engineers can react when a network issue occurs, before the

whole PLMN is down.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This function is enabled by default.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## Appendix A.b: 22.Q1: Improved PLMN Service and X2 related Alarm Handling

PLMN Service Unavailable alarm is now moved from a cell MO to

eNodeBFunction MO. This allows to avoid too many alarms which are not

actionable.

| Feature Name:           | Efficient Fault Management   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5338                 |
| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package             |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400                 |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node          |
| Access Type:            | LTE                          |

PLMN Service Unavailable alarm is moved to the node level

with corresponding secondary alarms on the cell level: Service Unavailable and Service Degraded. A new parameter,

ENodeBFunction.plmnServiceAlarmFilterTime, allows to delay PLMN

Service alarms notifications. When a cell is disabled without an alarm, an alert is

sent. The user can return to legacy behavior by setting parameter

ENodeBFunction.plmnServiceAlarmLevel to CELL.

Benefits

- The number of incoming node-level alarms is reduced.
- The user can choose between legacy and new behavior by configuring parameter ENodeBFunction.plmnServiceAlarmLevel or ENodeBFunction.plmnServiceAlarmFilterTime.
- The user can configure dedicated parameters for PLMN Service, X2, and EN-DC links and choose if they want to see link break immediately, or to have the alarm raised later, when they consider it as actionable. The following parameters can be set to a chosen value, to delay the appearance of alarms: For PLMN Service (S1), the ENodeBFunction.plmnServiceAlarmFilterTime parameter is set to delay PLMN Service Unavailable and PLMN Redundancy Lost alarms. For X2, the ENodeBFunction.externalLinkFailureFilterTime parameter is set to delay the External Link Failure alarm. The timer starts after the first failed recovery attempt. For EN-DC, the externalLinkToGNodeBFailureFilterTime parameter is set to delay the External Link to GNodeB Failure alarm. The timer starts after the first failed recovery attempt.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The functionality is enabled by default. The MO on which PLMN Service

Unavailable alarm is raised, is determined by the

ENodeBFunction.plmnServiceAlarmLevel parameter.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement provides the following benefit:

- An advanced filter capability is introduced to allow the user to define precise conditions that examine variable contents of alarm or alert fields. These conditions decide if a notification is sent out to ENM or suppressed.

The introduced mechanism is a general Fault Management function. The function is

applicable for all alarms and alerts generated in the node. This includes all Radio

Access Technologies deployed in the node.

Suppressed alarms and alerts are still logged on the node in Alarm Log and Alert

Log.

The FmAlarm MO is instantiated for all active alarms whether they

have been notified or not.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The MOM is modified by introducing the following MO classes:

- FmFilterModel
- FmFilter

Decisions to notify or suppress a given notification are taken based on the variable

content of the notification. There already exists a notification filtering which

relies on the FmAlarmType.isNotified attribute.

The FmAlarm:isNotified attribute indicates if an alarm or alert is

notified or suppressed when it is raised. This attribute is visible in Alarm Log,

Alert Log, and instances of FmAlarm for active alarms.

Alarms with either perceived severity or configured severity set to

CRITICAL cannot be suppressed.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                    |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces a delay filter mechanism to avoid superfluous

cell alert notifications when the cell becomes unavailable due to short recovery

actions, which means that Cell Service Unavailable Auto Recovery

Initiated alert is shortly followed by Cell Service

Available Auto Recovery Successful alert, or Service

Unavailable alarm.

This feature enhancement results in the following benefits:

- Substantially decreases the number of unnecessary alerts.
- Operators will not be notified about superfluous alerts to ensure the faults are persistent before raising primary and service alarm.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

Operator will observe significant decrease in number of Cell alert notifications.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No specific requirements on ENM.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                    |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces alerts to notify the operator that the cell is

temporarily degraded or disabled because of an automatically initiated recovery

action.

When the recovery is successful, the operator is notified with an alert that the cell

is enabled.

The alert notifications are visible in the ENM Alarm Monitor application and in the

Baseband Radio Node alert log.

A single alert does not require operator intervention. However, if an unexpected or

high rate of cell alerts is seen on node or network level, Ericsson Support should

be contacted (a Customer Support Request including Data collection, see Data Collection Guideline).

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The cell alerts are notified on the Baseband Radio Node by default. The user can

suppress alerts by setting the isNotified attribute to

SUPPRESSED on the related FmAlarmType MO

instance.

For more information about cell alerts, see Manage Faults and the corresponding OPIs.
