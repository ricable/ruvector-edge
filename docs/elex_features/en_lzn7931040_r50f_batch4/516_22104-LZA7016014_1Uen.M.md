Summary

The feature allows the node to support up to four, manually configured IPv4 addresses on the

same VLAN. The addresses either belong to different, non-overlapping subnets or

identical subnets.

The IP addresses are configured manually. A primary IP address must be configured, for when

the system must use a single address.

# 2 Dependencies of Multiple IP Addresses on the Same VLAN

The feature does not support automatic IP

configuration.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement

Limitations

Automatic IP configuration is not supported in the feature.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Multiple IP Addresses on the Same VLAN

A maximum of four IP addresses can be set manually under the same

InterfaceIPv4 or InterfaceIPv6

MO.

Multiple IPv4 Address Configuration

The IPv4 addresses set under the same InterfaceIPv4 MO can belong

to different, non-overlapping, or identical subnets. One IPv4 address must be set as

the primary address.

1. Up to four AddressIPv4 MOs are created.
2. The AddressIPv4.configurationMode attribute is set to MANUAL for each AddressIPv4 MO.
3. The AddressIPv4.primaryAddress attribute is set to false for all except one AddressIPv4 MOs.

Multiple IPv6 Address Configuration

The IPv6 addresses set under the same InterfaceIPv6 MO can belong

to different, non-overlapping, or identical subnets. One IPv6 address must be set as

the primary address.

1. Up to four AddressIPv6 MOs are created.
2. The AddressIPv6.configurationMode attribute is set to MANUAL for each AddressIPv6 MO.
3. The AddressIPv6.primaryAddress attribute is set to false for all except one AddressIPv6 MOs.

If the IP application does not provide source IPv6 address, and if the IPv6 addresses

configured for a VLAN do not belong to the same subnet, the source address might not

belong to the same subnet as the next hop address.

# 4 Network Impact of Multiple IP Addresses on the Same VLAN

The feature has no network

impact.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

To facilitate proper functioning of the network, if the IPv6 addresses configured for

a VLAN port do not belong to the same subnet, the configuration for the

corresponding VLAN port in the next hop router must include addresses for all of the

subnets.

# 5 Parameters for Multiple IP Addresses on the Same VLAN

The feature introduced a new parameter in the AddressIPv4 MO, and

affects an existing one in

InterfaceIPv4.

Table 1   Parameters

| Parameter                     | Type       | Description                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AddressIPv4.primaryAddress    | Introduced | See MOM description                                                                                                |
| InterfaceIPv4.AddressIPv4     | Affected   | Up to 4 AddressIPv4 MOs can be created under one                                 instance of the InterfaceIPv4 MO. |
| AddressIPv4.configurationMode | Affected   | The attribute has to be set to MANUAL for each                                     AddressIPv4 MO.                 |

# 6 Performance of Multiple IP Addresses on the Same VLAN

The feature has no associated KPIs, counters or

events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Deactivate Basic Feature

This is a basic feature. It does not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

Benefits

The enhancement allows the node to support up to four, manually configured IPv4

addresses on the same VLAN, belonging to identical subnets.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

A maximum of four AddressIPv4 MOs can be created under the same

InterfaceIPv4 MO. The addresses can belong to different,

non-overlapping subnets or identical subnets. The

AddressIPv4.configurationMode attribute must be set to

MANUAL for each AddressIPv4 MO.

One IPv4 address must be set as the primary address for cases when the system must

use a single address. This is done by setting the

AddressIPv4.primaryAddress attribute to

true.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 21.1 or later is required for this feature.

## Appendix A.b: 21.Q4: Enhancement in Multiple IP Addresses on the Same VLAN

This enhancement for the Multiple IP Addresses on the Same VLAN feature enables the

support of up to four manually configured IPv6 addresses on one VLAN. The addresses must

either have one identical prefix, or different and non-overlapping prefixes.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This enhancement for the Multiple IP Addresses on the Same VLAN feature enables the

configuration of up to four AddressIPv6 MOs under one

InterfaceIPv6 MO. One of the AddressIPv6

MOs must be configured as the primary address. This is done by setting the

AddressIPv6.primaryAddress attribute to

true. For the rest of the AddressIPv6 MOs, the

AddressIPv6.primaryAddress attribute must be set to

false.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
