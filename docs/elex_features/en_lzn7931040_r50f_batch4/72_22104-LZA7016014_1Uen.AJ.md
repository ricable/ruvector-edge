# 3 Feature Operation of RRC Connection Re-establishment

The feature operates by using messages related to RRC connection re-establishment

between the UE and the eNodeB.

Figure 1   Operational Sequence Diagram

1. The RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure is triggered by the UE by sending the RRC Connection Reestablishment Request message to the eNodeB. The Rrc.t301 timer is started by the UE to control reception of the RRC Connection Reestablishment message.
2. During the Rrc.t301 period of time, the eNodeB re-activates the AS security (without changing algorithms), resumes the SRB1 operation, and sends the RRC Connection Reestablishment message to the UE.
3. The Re-establishment procedure is completed by reception of the RRC Connection Reestablishment Complete message which is sent on the SRB1 from the UE.
4. After a successful re-establishment, the eNodeB sends an RRC Connection Reconfiguration message. This is to resume SRB2, and DRBs, and to reconfigure the measurement configuration.
5. The UE sends an RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete message to the eNodeB when the process is completed.

It is possible that the target eNodeB cannot interpret the

UE-dedicated configuration in the HandoverPreparationInformation message

sent by the serving eNodeB. If this occurs because of ASN.1 version mismatch, the target

eNodeB can use the full configuration option to reconfigure the UE.

An RRC Connection Re-establishment failure happens in the

following cases:

- The re-establishment request is initiated towards a cell other than the serving cell. Note: The Multi-Target RRC Connection Re-establishment feature can handle re-establishment requests that are initiated towards a cell that is not the serving cell.
- One of the following RRC procedures are ongoing: Handover E-RAB Setup E-RAB Release E-RAB Modification UE Context Setup UE Context Release UE Context Modification

The eNodeB responds to the UE with an RRC

Connection Reestablishment Reject message, the ongoing procedure times out

after the value of the Rrc.t301 attribute. The RRC Connection Release

is triggered, causing the UE to go to RRC\_IDLE state.

RRC connection re-establishment does not generate any load in the MME, as no signaling

over S1 is done. A  voice call (VoLTE or PTT) is not disconnected due to a

re-establishment.

# 4 Parameters for RRC Connection Re-establishment

The feature has a configuration parameter for activating the feature.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter                         | Type       | Description          |
|-----------------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| ENodeBFunction.rrcConnReestActive | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 5 Activate RRC Connection Re-establishment

This is a basic feature. It does not require manual license activation. However the

feature must be enabled manually.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the ENodeBFunction.rrcConnReestActive attribute to true to activate the feature.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.

# 6 Deactivate RRC Connection Re-establishment

This is a basic feature. It does not require manual license activation. However, the

feature must be disabled manually.

Prerequisites

- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.

Steps

1. Set the ENodeBFunction.rrcConnReestActive attribute to false to deactivate the feature.

After This Task

Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.
