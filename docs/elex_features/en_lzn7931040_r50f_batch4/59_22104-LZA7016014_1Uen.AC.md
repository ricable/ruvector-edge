# 1 64-QAM Downlink Overview

The  feature enables higher modulation format, which increases downlink peak

rates.

| Feature Name           | 64-QAM Downlink                                         |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 0487                                            |
| Value Package Name     | LTE Base Package                                        |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0400                                            |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                     |
| Access Type            | LTE                                                     |
| Licensing              | Non-license-controlled feature. No license is required. |

# 2 Dependencies of 64-QAM Downlink

This feature has no dependencies or limitations.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No known limitations.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of 64-QAM Downlink

The feature enables higher modulation format, which transfers more information in each

radio frame. This results in a higher peak rate when the channel conditions are

good.

The downlink peak rates are increased by about 50% compared to 16-QAM modulation.

# 4 Parameters for 64-QAM Downlink

The feature has no configuration parameters.

# 5 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
