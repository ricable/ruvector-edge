Summary

The GTP-U Supervision feature includes the following functions:

- Transmission of GTP-U echo requests for S1-U and X2-U peers. Private extension is not supported.
- Transmission of GTP-U echo responses in reply to incoming GTP-U echo requests for all user plane peers. Private extension is supported.
- Reception of incoming GTP-U error indications for S1-U peers.
- Transmission of outgoing GTP-U error indications for received G-PDUs on unknown TEID for all user plane peers. Baseband Radio Node adds a UDP port extension header to the GTP-U error indication.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitation

Incoming call is not rejected even if the GTP-U path becomes unreachable.

GTP-U Echo Originator for ENDC X2 user plane interfaces is not supported.

Bearer handling at the reception of a GTP-U Error Indication message on the X2 and

ENDC X2 user plane interfaces is not supported.

If the GTP-U Supervision feature and the Multiple IP Addresses for S1 and X2 feature

are active at the same time, the GTP-U Supervision feature on X2 is limited to one

GTP-U path for each neighboring eNodeB.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of GTP-U Supervision

This feature monitors S1-U and X2-U peers with GTP-U echo request

messages.

Operational Process

The GTP-U Supervision feature includes the following functions:

- Transmission of GTP-U echo responses in reply to incoming GTP-U echo requests. Private extension is supported.
- Reception of incoming GTP-U error indications.
- Transmission of outgoing GTP-U error indications for received G-PDUs on unknown TEID. Baseband Radio Node adds a UDP port extension header to the GTP-U error indication.

The DSCP values of the outgoing GTP-U error indication messages can be specified in

the ENodeBFunction.gtpuErrorIndicationDscp attribute.

The feature consists of a GTP-U echo originator that monitors S1-U and X2-U peers by

sending GTP-U echo request messages. For each peer, the following services are

provided:

- Basic measurements for all peers
- Detection of change in peer reachability status for S1-U and X2-U peers
- Round-trip delay measurements for S1-U peers

If no GTP-U echo response message is received after five GTP-U echo requests, the

peer reachability status changes to unreachable. Three consecutive GTP-U echo

response messages are required for a corresponding peer to change its reachability

status to reachable.

For S1-U, the value set for ENodeBFunction.s1GtpuEchoFailureAction

determines what action to take when an S1-U peer becomes unreachable.

A persistent GtpPath MO is automatically created for each GTP-U

peer when the monitoring starts. If there is no user plane traffic to a peer, no

GtpPath MO is created, even if the corresponding

TermPointToENB MO exists.

The monitoring starts when the first GTP-U tunnel is set to the peer, and ends 35

minutes after the last tunnel is

released. For

RAN Compute group 6, the monitoring ends 30 minutes after the last tunnel is

released.

All X2 and S1 GTP-U peers can be monitored.

The GtpPath MO is automatically removed if the monitoring ends, or

the monitoring is not started for one hour after node restart.

# 4 Network Impact of GTP-U Supervision

The operation of this feature has no impact on the network.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

and responses as well as GTP-U error indicators.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 18.Q2: Ericsson Private Extension Support for GTP-U Echo Responder

This feature enhancement adds support for the Ericsson Private Extension in the GTP-U

responder on the Baseband Radio Node. This makes it possible for a remote GTP-U peer to

perform advanced measurements of delay and delay variation towards the Baseband Radio

Node.

The enhancement of GTP-U Supervision introduces a new PM counter on Baseband Radio Node under

the GtpPath MO.

## Appendix A.b: 18.Q4: Monitoring of S1 GTP-U Quality

The

enhancement introduces new counters to monitor S1-U links.

| Access Type:            | LTE                                              |

The enhancement extends the usage of GTP-U sequence discontinuity counters for improved

monitoring of S1-U link by using Pm counters instead of Pm events and introducing new Pm

counters. It improves the accessibility and visibility of the S1-U downlink performance

by using Pm counters to continuously monitor quality of the link. Lost and

out-of-ordered packets in S1-U downlink packets also can be detected.

Capacity and Performance

The enhancement introduces the following new performance indicators:

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement enables measurements and the collection of PM counters for

round-trip delay of 3GPP GTP Echo messages for S1-U interfaces.

Round-trip delay measurements allow users to estimate the delay of uplink and

downlink user plane packets sent between eNodeB and SGW. By measuring round-trip

delay values on S1-U links, it is possible to predict the quality of

latency-dependent services.

There is no impact on the peer nodes. The round-trip delay measurements are available

on S1-U links to the SGW of any vendor.

The feature has the following limitations:

- Incoming call is not rejected even if the GTP-U path becomes unreachable.
- GTP-U echo originator and bearer handling for EN-DC is not supported.
- If the GTP-U Supervision feature and the Multiple IP Addresses for S1 and X2 feature are active at the same time, the GTP-U Supervision feature on X2 is limited to one GTP-U path for each neighboring eNodeB.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

Round-trip delay measurements are started by default for all S1-U GTP paths when the

GTP-U Supervision feature for S1-U is activated by setting the value of the

ENodeBFunction.s1GtpuEchoEnable attribute to

PERIODIC.

The feature enhancement introduces the following PM counters for round-trip

delay:

- GtpPath.pmRTDDistr

The feature enhancement reuses the following legacy PM counters for round-trip

delay:

- GtpPath.pmRTDAvg
- GtpPath.pmRTDMax
- GtpPath.pmRTDMin

Interfaces

Round-trip delay measurements and related PM counters are not supported for X2-U

interfaces, but only applicable for S1-U interfaces.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No specific network requirements.
