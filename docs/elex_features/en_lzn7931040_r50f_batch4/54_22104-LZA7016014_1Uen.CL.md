Summary

The purpose of the Basic Load Management feature is to protect the node and its cells from

overload while minimizing the impact to the traffic.

Basic Load Management comes with the following benefits:

- Reduced risk of node crash.
- Efficient resource allocation within the Main Processor (MP) to reduce the delay for traffic and Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) procedures.
- Maximized traffic throughput at loads above engineered capacity.
- Improved performance, allowing increased MP load before traffic rejection.
- Avoidance of cells being stuck in an overloaded state due to air interface congestion.
- Improved Retainability through overload protection.
- Improved accessibility for high priority calls (for example, Emergency, High Priority Access) during high MP load.
- Overload protection against signaling storms.

# 2 Dependencies of Basic Load Management

The Basic Load Management feature has various related and conflicting features. It

also affects incoming handovers and initial establishment in overload

situations.

System Functions

When Basic Load Management mechanisms act in overload situations, incoming handovers

and initial establishment can be rejected.

Hardware

No special hardware requirement is expected for this feature.

# 3 Basic Load Management Operation

Several self-contained functions make up the Basic Load Management feature. These

functions are listed in this section.

The feature consists of the following self-contained functions:

- Paging Intensity Control
- Baseband Connection Intensity Control
- Static Cell Connection Intensity Control
- MP Load Control
- Procedure Latency Supervision
- Access Class Barring
- Baseband Management Interface Intensity Control

Privileged access, such as Emergency and HPA, are always allowed to connect, except when MP

Load Control is in OVERLOAD state.

## 3.1 Paging Intensity Control

Paging Intensity Control is a load protection mechanism that limits the number of

paging messages processed within a certain time frame.

To guarantee that the paging function in eNodeB always works as intended, an overload

protection mechanism is included. This limits the number of paging messages processed within a

certain time. The load protection mechanism protects both the control plane and O&amp;M

functions executing in the MP. It also protects user plane functions in the baseband unit on

both eNodeB and Cell levels.

During normal operation, the Paging Intensity Control ensures that only a predefined number

of paging messages are handled within a certain time period.

Figure 1 and Figure 2 provide overviews

of the Paging Intensity Control.

Figure 1   Paging Intensity Control

Figure 2   Paging Intensity Window

The operation is accepted and sent to the UE when one of the following conditions is met:

- The paging intensity in either the eNodeB or the cell is below the maximum number of allowed paging messages for the current period.
- The paging intensity in either the eNodeB or the cell is equal to the maximum number of allowed paging messages for the current period.

Otherwise, the paging is discarded.

The MP Load Control mechanism can adjust the number of allowed

paging requests.

## 3.2 Baseband Connection Intensity Control

Baseband Connection Intensity Control is a load protection mechanism. It ensures that

only a predefined number of initial establishments and incoming handovers are processed within a

certain time frame.

To guarantee that the connection handling in eNodeB always works as intended, a load

protection mechanism is included. This limits the number of simultaneous initial

establishments and incoming handovers processed within a certain time. The load protection

mechanism protects the following:

- The control plane executing in the MP
- O&amp;M functions executing in the MP
- User plane functions in the Baseband unit on eNodeB level

Figure 3 and Figure 4 provide

overviews of the Baseband Connection Intensity Control. During normal operation, the Baseband

Connection Intensity Control ensures that only a predefined number of initial establishments

and incoming handovers are handled within a certain time period.

Figure 3   Baseband Connection Intensity Control

Figure 4   Baseband Connection Intensity Window

The connection is accepted and set up if one of the following conditions is met:

- The sum of initial establishments and incoming handovers is below the maximum number of allowed connections for the current period.
- The sum of initial establishments and incoming handovers is equal to the maximum number of allowed connections for the current period.

Otherwise, the connection is rejected.

The MP Load Control mechanism can adjust the number of allowed initial establishments and

incoming handovers by the following:

- The Baseband Connection Intensity Windows Short
- The Baseband Connection Intensity Windows Long

## 3.3 Static Cell Connection Intensity Control

Static Cell Connection Intensity Control is a load protection mechanism. It ensures

that the quality of service for the connected user is maintained on the cell level.

To guarantee the radio resource utilization in the cell, a load protection mechanism is

included. This is achieved by allowing only a predefined number of initial establishments and

incoming handovers to be handled within a certain time period.

Figure 5 and Figure 6 provide

overviews of the Static Cell Connection Intensity Control.

Figure 5   Static Cell Connection Intensity Control

Figure 6   Static Cell Connection Intensity Window

The connection is accepted and set up if the following conditions are met:

- The sum of initial establishments and incoming handovers is below the maximum number of allowed connections for the current period.
- The sum of initial establishments and incoming handovers is equal to the maximum number of allowed connections for the current period.

Otherwise, the connection is rejected.

The cell connection intensity control mechanism can adjust the number of allowed initial

establishments and incoming handovers by the Cell Connection Intensity Window (CCIW).

## 3.4 MP Load Control

MP Load Control is designed using several main principles in order for the eNodeB to

utilize its resources in an optimal way and avoid overload.

MP Load Control strives to maintain the processor load below a target value by regulating

the admitted traffic.

Steps

To utilize the resources of the eNodeB in an optimal way and avoid overload, MP Load

Control is designed using the following main principles:

1. Allocation of resources is performed as efficiently as possible.
2. The CPU overhead contributed by the operation of the MP Load Control mechanism is kept to a minimum.
3. The system protects itself from overload by rejecting activities when processing resources are busy. MP Load Control uses the load control and overload protection mechanisms to fulfill these overall goals. Note: MP Load Control regulates the incoming traffic intensity and is not related to the amount of UEs that are connected to the eNodeB. MP Load Control can therefore reject incoming traffic even if the licensed number of users is not reached.

### 3.4.1 MP Load Control and MP Overload Protection

MP Load Control and MP Overload Protection protect the eNodeB from being

overloaded.

Load control and overload protection of incoming traffic is done to protect the eNodeB from

being overloaded. In normal operation, the permitted intensity limits are periodically

adjusted based on the current MP Load Control state. The permitted intensity limit is checked

before each load controlled activity is permitted to start. If the limit is reached, the

activity gets rejected. Furthermore, the load control mechanism is designed to allow CPU time

for lower priority and background activities to avoid starvation of O&amp;M activities.

The MP Load Control algorithm strives to keep the processor load from exceeding the target

level. New RRC connection setups, incoming handovers and pagings request the required capacity

for load control before proceeding. The load management algorithm dynamically sets the

permitted intensity limits for RRC connection setups, incoming handovers and pagings based on

continuous MP load measurements. When MP load measurements indicate that the MP load is higher

than the target value, the permitted intensity limits are decreased. When MP load measurements

indicate that the MP load is lower than the target value, the permitted intensity limits are

increased.

Load control and overload protection actions, and their severity, depend on the MP Load

Control state.

These actions are designed to adhere to the following principles:

- Reject all activities in state OVERLOAD.
- Reject part of the traffic in state VERY HIGH.
- Reject activities that do not directly impact traffic in state HIGH.
- No load control activities are required in state NOT HIGH.

#### 3.4.1.1 MP Load Control Mechanism

MP Load Control mechanism regulates activities in different states using state

variables.

Figure 7 provides an overview of how the

load control mechanism regulates certain activities in different states using state

variables.

Figure 7   MP Load Control Mechanism

Average MP Core Load

MP Core load is measured as a moving average of the total load on the MP cores available

to the LTE application.

Table 2 shows the four average MP Load

Control states that can be derived from the average MP core load.

Table 2   Average MP Core Load States

| Average MP Core Load   | Average MP Core Load State   |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Greater than 95%       | OVERLOAD                     |
| 90% to 95%             | VERY HIGH                    |
| 80% to 89%             | HIGH                         |
| Less than 80%          | NOT HIGH                     |

Software Component Load

In addition to the average MP core load, a software component load control monitors

single threaded software components. The software component measurement is added since

an average load measured over multiple cores does not protect a single core from being

overloaded by a single threaded software component.

The software component load control regulates the allowed traffic intensities when the

load of any such software component exceeds target levels of the capacity of any MP

core, see Table 3.

Table 3   Software Component Load States

| Software Component Load   | Software Component Load States   |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Greater than 95%          | OVERLOAD                         |
| 90% to 95%                | VERY HIGH                        |
| 70% to 90%                | HIGH                             |
| Less than 70%             | NOT HIGH                         |

MP Load Control State

The MP Load Control state is set to the highest state of the average MP Core Load state

and Software Component Load state.

MP Load Control Actions

The required action to be taken for each MP Load Control state is described in Table 4.

Table 4   MP Load Control Actions

| MP Load Control State   | Paging                                                                                                                                                                                                       | RRC Connection Setups and Handovers                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OVERLOAD                | Discards all incoming paging.                                                                                                                                                                                | Rejects all RRC connection setups and incoming handovers.                                                                                                                                                             |
| VERY HIGH               | Rejects more pagings than in the last measurement interval by                                 decreasing the permitted intensity limit.                                                                      | Rejects more RRC connection setups and more incoming handovers than                                 in the previous measurement interval by decreasing the permitted                                 intensity limit. |
| HIGH                    | If the permitted intensity limit is not at its maximum size, it is                                 increased at each measurement interval until it reaches the maximum                                 size. | If the permitted intensity limit is not at its maximum size, it is                                 increased at each measurement interval until it reaches the maximum                                 size.          |
| NOT HIGH                | Performs overload protection using the maximum size of the permitted                                 intensity limit.                                                                                        | Performs overload protection using the maximum size of the permitted                                 intensity limit.                                                                                                 |

RRC Connection Requests corresponding to Emergency and HPA are allowed regardless of the

permitted intensity when the MP Load is in NOT HIGH, HIGH, or VERY HIGH states.

In state OVERLOAD, all RRC Connection requests are rejected including Emergency and

HPA.

Cell Component Load Control

The MP usage of the cell components is monitored in the same way as the software

components monitored by the Software Component Level Load control. When the load of such

cell components exceed an overload threshold of 95%, the incoming traffic is rejected in

that specific cell.

### 3.4.2 Optimizing MP Load

To reduce MP load, traffic behavior and UE handling functions must be

optimized.

The largest contributors to MP load are service requests, releases, handovers, pagings,

counter, and event handling. Therefore, the focus is on optimizing factors that affect these

UE handling functions. Some of the key factors to optimize are summarized below.

| Traffic Behavior                                |    | An increase in signaling increases the MP load. It is recommended to reduce signaling             activity by optimizing the air interface. A radio network with good conditions reduces             the signaling activity compared to a radio network with impaired radio conditions. A             higher inactivity timer value also decreases the signaling load on the air interface,             and the load on the MP.   |
|-------------------------------------------------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                 |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| UE                                              |    | UE behavior affects the MP load. UE applications that poll servers such as email             applications increase signaling, which in turn increases MP load. Typically, smartphones             use such applications more frequently than other devices, which results in an increased             MP load. Optimizing the radio conditions for the UE and traffic types helps reduce the             MP load.                 |
|                                                 |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Paging                                          |    | Paging is used by the network to communicate with the UE during idle mode. Typically, a             page is broadcast in all cells belonging to the Tracking Area (TA) in which the UE             resides. Reducing the size of the TA reduces the number of cells being paged, and             thereby reduces the load on the MP.                                                                                              |

To reduce the load on the MP in addition to these key factors, optimization of RAN

parameters, eNodeB functions, and Baseband functions must be regularly performed.

These operations are mainly realized by the load modules cellLm,

centralLm, and monitorLm. At high signaling

intensities, these load modules consume a major part of the available CPU cycles. These load

modules are scheduled on the cores that are available for the LTE Application.

- Load module centralLm primarily handles signaling to Baseband Radio Node external nodes, for example S1 and X2, and interwork with load module cellLm.
- Load modules monitorLm and distmonLmprimarily handle Performance Management operations, that is counter and event generation.
- Load module cellLm primarily handles UE signaling. From an execution point of view, it is structured in several processes where each process represents a cell. Each process is allocated to a processing core. The cells are placed in a process determined by the configuration data of the expected cell traffic load.

## 3.5 Procedure Latency Supervision

Procedure Latency Supervision is a load control mechanism that protects the cells and

air interfaces.

The eNodeB to UE and back round-trip latency for some RRC procedures is time-supervised.

Statistics of the measured time of these procedures are collected. When the median latency of

the procedures is above 300 ms, overload protection actions are taken. A high latency of RRC

procedures indicates that the cell air interface is too busy, and rejection of new traffic is

necessary to restore normal operation. The Procedure Latency Supervision operates on a cell

level.

The RRC procedure latency of Category M1 UEs is significantly higher than that of legacy LTE UEs.

This is due to the introduction of repetitions in Coverage Enhancement. Although it is

acceptable for Category M1 UEs to have long procedure latency, they can trigger overload protection

mechanisms applied to legacy LTE UEs. Therefore, the procedure latency of the Category M1 UEs is

excluded from the measurement to avoid triggering the load control mechanism.

Figure 8 provides an overview of Procedure Latency Supervision.

Figure 8   Procedure Latency Supervision

The supervised RRC procedures are as follows:

- Security mode setup
- UE capability enquiry
- Connection reconfiguration
- Connection setup

The combined median of all RRC procedures is supervised. The

latencydistribution counters can be used to find the most problematic

procedures when Procedure Latency has caused rejects. These counters are not useful for

proactive performance management. Cell congestion often develops quickly with a rise of

procedure latency.

When the Procedure Latency Supervision is in state Blocking, all incoming

traffic requests are rejected for a period of time. When that time has expired, new incoming

traffic requests are permitted and the RRC procedures are time-supervised again. Privileged

access, such as Emergency and HPA, are admitted regardless of the Blocking

state.

A high value of the SignalingRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitDl and

SignalingRadioBearer.tPollRetransmitUl for SR attributes tend to increase

RRC procedure latency. This is because SRB RLC retransmits take longer time.

At the same time, the optional Prioritized SR Scheduling feature often improves the RRC

procedure latency.

The RRC UE capability enquiry procedure measures the time

between the UECapabilityEnquiry and the

UECapabilityInformation messages. When the UE performs message

segmentation, the additional messages and the reassembly of the segments increase the

time between the two messages. This results in higher median latency. Therefore, when

message segmentation takes place, the latency is measured between the

UECapabilityEnquiry and the first

UlDedicatedMessageSegment messages.

Access Class Barring can be configured to prevent bad accessibility, bad retainability,

low throughput, or all three in an overloaded cell.

To prevent these from happening, Access Class Barring can be manually configured to limit the

number of initial establishments in the cell momentarily. Access Class Barring information is

broadcasted in SIB2.

The Baseband Management Interface Intensity Control mechanism protects the User Plane

control logic from overload.

In normal situations, the other load control mechanisms reject at high RRC signaling

intensities. This way, the load control mechanism is triggered to preserve stable behavior in

extreme situations. The Baseband Management Interface Intensity Control operates on a per

Baseband unit level.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 17.Q4: Procedure Latency Supervision and Dynamic Load Control Improvements for Category M

This feature excludes both the procedure latency and the UE drop rate generated by

Category M1 UEs from Procedure Latency Supervision and Dynamic Load Control. If the number

of Category M1 UEs that are trying to connect exceeds the system capacity, additional

Category M1 UEs are treated as LTE UEs without privilege access.

The number of Category M1 UEs that can connect is determined by the system capacity. If more

Category M1 UEs try to connect, they are rejected and treated as LTE UEs without

privilege access. These rejections trigger Dynamic UE Admission Control if the Dynamic

UE Admission Control thresholds are reached.

For information on current capacity figures, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for LTE RAN and

Massive IoT RAN.

Benefits

The improvement provides the following benefits:

- Emergency calls and services with high priority access are not rejected by the overload protection mechanism of the Procedure Latency Supervision feature.
- Exclusion of both the procedure latency and the UE drop rate generated by Category M1 UEs from Procedure Latency Supervision and Dynamic Load Control.

Capacity and Performance

Since emergency and high priority access calls are accepted in overload situations, a minor

increase in accessibility is detected. When the Category M1 UEs do not incorrectly

trigger overload, an overall increase in accessibility is achieved.
