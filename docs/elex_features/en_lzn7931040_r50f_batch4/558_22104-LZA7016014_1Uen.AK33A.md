Summary

When two or more carrier frequencies are blended in a radio system that contains

non-linearities, it is possible that the two signals create PIM. PIM signals created

by downlink carriers might interfere with signals transmitted by uplink

carriers.

The X2AP is used to establish victim-aggressor relationships and the ERAN tunnel is

used to report necessary information from victim to aggressor.

This feature provides the following benefits:

- Increased uplink throughput of victim cells through the configuration of PIM avoidance.
- Increased observability of PIM avoidance gains through PM counters.

# 2 Dependencies of LTE PIM Avoidance

The accuracy of the results provided by the LTE PIM Avoidance feature might be

affected by other active features.

Hardware

The feature is only supported on remote radio units.

Limitations

- The feature only supports LTE FDD cells.
- A victim eNodeB can send PIM measurements to a maximum of two external aggressor eNodeBs. For more information, see LTE PIM Detection.
- An aggressor eNodeB can receive PIM measurements from a maximum of four external victim eNodeBs.
- The LTE PIM Avoidance feature is not supported on eNodeBs configured with two LTE capacity modules in a mixed mode configuration.

Network Requirements

It is required to use ENM version 24.1 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature.

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE PIM Avoidance

The feature performs PIM avoidance automatically based on the LTE PIM Detection feature,

or through manually configured aggressor cell selection. PIM avoidance is possible within a

single node and between multiple nodes.

The feature introduces PIM avoidance based on measured and detected PIM information for

LTE FDD cells. PIM is reduced by identifying cells that cause PIM and muting a part of

the downlink traffic from these cells.

Static PIM avoidance mutes a preconfigured number of PRBs and works between cells on a

single node.

Dynamic PIM avoidance calculates the number of PRBs to mute, and starts muting from the

PRB muting start point, which can be provided by the LTE PIM Detection feature or

manually configured using the EUtranCellFDD.pimManualMutingStartPoint

attribute.

Dynamic PIM avoidance works between cells on a single node and between cells on multiple

nodes connected through fast links, which are set up by the LTE PIM Avoidance

feature.

It is not recommended to enable PIM avoidance on the aggressor cell hosting Category M

Access or NB-IoT Access in in-band deployment mode, as it might cause performance

loss.

Operational Process for Dynamic PIM Avoidance

Dynamic PIM avoidance can be activated when the Elastic RAN feature is activated.

Automatic configuration can be activated when the LTE PIM Detection feature is

activated. For more information on these features, see LTE PIM Detection and Elastic RAN.

For more information on enabling or disabling dynamic PIM avoidance, see Enable Dynamic LTE PIM Avoidance with Automatic Configuration and Enable Dynamic LTE PIM Avoidance with Manual Configuration.

1. The victim-aggressor pair is detected automatically based on the measurements of the LTE PIM Detection feature or through manual configuration.Note: A victim-aggressor pair on the same eNodeB has a higher priority than a local victim-aggressor pair on a remote eNodeB.
2. If a remote aggressor cell is selected, the local victim cell requests PIM avoidance association to the remote aggressor cell through an X2 connection. The remote aggressor cell requests a PIM power excess measurement to the victim cell and receives the confirmation through the X2 connection.
3. If a remote aggressor cell is selected, fast links are set up for PIM avoidance with the remote eNodeB using different IDLe or TN/IDL ports by the corresponding DL Carrier Aggregation feature and the Elastic RAN Uplink Coordianted Multi-Point Reception feature.Note: If all IDLe or TN/IDL ports are used for the DL Carrier Aggregation feature and the Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception feature, the LTE PIM Avoidance feature shares the ports with the Elastic RAN Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception feature.
4. The victim cell reports PIM power excess measurement periodically and the aggressor cell mitigates PIM by muting downlink PRBs.

Dynamic PIM Avoidance Status

The following attributes are used to monitor of cell status and paired cell

information:

- EUtranCellFDD.pimAvoidanceModeStatus
- EUtranCellFDD.pimVictimCellId
- EUtranCellFDD.pimVictimENodeBId
- EUtranCellFDD.pimAggressorCellId

# 4 Network Impact of LTE PIM Avoidance

This feature affects downlink KPIs.

Capacity and Performance

Configuring the feature with information on detected aggressors imposes a negative

KPI impact in downlink because of the occasional muting of the PDSCH resources that

aim to decrease PIM-originated interference power.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for LTE PIM Avoidance

This feature introduces various attributes related to the configuration of the

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

## 7.1 Enable Static LTE PIM Avoidance

Configuration of static PIM avoidance is done through the

SectorCarrier.pimMitigMinIntPwrAutoConfig attribute.

Configuration of static PIM avoidance has the following limitations:

- Static configuration cannot be used simultaneously with dynamic configuration. In case both configurations are enabled, dynamic configuration takes priority.
- Static PIM avoidance only supports single-node configuration.
- Static PIM avoidance only supports automatic configuration.

Prerequisites

- The EUtranCellFDD.pimAvoidanceControllerEnabled attribute is set to false.
- The LTE PIM Detection feature is enabled on the cell. For more information on the LTE PIM Detection feature, see LTE PIM Detection.

Steps

1. Set the SectorCarrier.pimMitigMinIntPwrAutoConfig attribute to a non-zero value.

## 7.2 Enable Dynamic LTE PIM Avoidance with Automatic Configuration

Automatic configuration for dynamic PIM avoidance is done through the

EUtranCellFDD.pimAvoidanceControllerEnabled attribute.

Prerequisites

The LTE PIM Detection feature is enabled on the cell. For more information on the LTE

PIM Detection feature, see LTE PIM Detection.

Dynamic PIM avoidance supports single-node

and multi-node

configuration.

EUtranCellFDD.pimAvoidanceControllerEnabled attribute, depending on

which configuration is used.

Steps

1. Do one of the following actions based on the used configuration: Configuration Process Static configuration Set the SectorCarrier.pimMitigMinIntPwrAutoConfig attribute to 0. Dynamic configuration Set the EUtranCellFDD.pimAvoidanceControllerEnabled attribute to false.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for LTE PIM Avoidance

VLAN configuration can be performed using a router or an IDLe connection.

VLAN configuration can be performed if a Baseband unit has a victim cell and an aggressor

cell connected with fast logical links. The connection can be established in the

following ways:

- Using a router Note: For eNodeBs with individual VLAN IDs, the associated ExternalENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef attribute must be set to the VlanPort supporting that VLAN ID.
- Directly through an IDLe connection Note: For eNodeBs with direct connectivity over a different IDLe, the associated ExternalENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef attribute must be set to the VlanPort supporting that IDLe.

VLAN configuration has the following limitations:

- If the ENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, the ENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef or the ENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef attribute is changed, all existing Elastic RAN links for PIM avoidance are torn down. The only exception is when the attribute is changed from not set to a valid VlanPort.
- If the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef or the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef attribute is changed, all existing Elastic RAN links for PIM avoidance associated with the ExternalENodeBFunction for which change was performed are torn down. The only exception is when the attribute is changed from not set to a valid VlanPort.
- If the VlanPort.encapsulation or the VlanPort.vlanId attribute under the ENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, the ENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef or the ENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef attribute is modified, all existing Elastic RAN links for PIM avoidance are torn down.
- If the VlanPort.encapsulation or the VlanPort.vlanId attribute under the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranVlanPortRef, the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef or the ExternalENodeBFunction.eranPimVlanPortRef attribute is modified, all existing Elastic RAN links for PIM avoidance associated with the ExternalENodeBFunction for which change was performed are torn down.

## 9.2 25.Q1.0: Shared LTE RAN and Muting Support LTE PIM Avoidance

This feature enhancement introduces support for the Shared LTE RAN feature and

flexible PRB muting for the LTE PIM Avoidance feature.

| Feature Name           | LTE PIM Avoidance   |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5448        |
| Value Package Name     | LTE Base Package    |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0400        |
| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node |
| Access Type            | LTE                 |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional            |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces support for the Shared LTE RAN feature and PRB

muting start point using the results of the LTE PIM Detection feature or manual

configuration.

This feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- Reduced interference from PIM in Shared LTE RAN configurations
- Enhanced LTE PIM Avoidance to mute as little of the downlink while maintaining uplink gains

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the

ENodeBFunction.pimaPlmnAgnostic attribute. If the attribute

is set to false, multi-node PIM avoidance ignores aggressor cells

if the victim cell has a different PLMN. If the attribute is set to

true, multi-node PIM avoidance is agnostic to PLMN when

selecting aggressors.

This feature enhancement introduces the PRB muting start point where the LTE PIM

Avoidance feature starts muting downlink PRBs of an aggressor cell. The PRB muting

start point is either determined by the LTE PIM Detection feature or configured

manually using the EUtranCellFDD.pimManualMutingStartPoint

attribute. Manually configured muting takes priority over automatic muting.

It is not recommended to enable PIM avoidance on the aggressor cell hosting Category

M Access or NB-IoT Access in in-band deployment mode, as it might cause performance

loss.

Interfaces

This feature enhancement affects the X2AP interface, which is used to convey the PRB

muting start point of a remote aggressor cell.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
