does not support cascaded radio units.

It

does not support ESS FDD cell, Combined Cells, or Standalone NB-IoT cells hosted by

LTE cells.

Network Requirements

It is recommended to use ENM version 21.3 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager

application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.

# 3 Feature Operation of Radio Deep Sleep Mode

Radio

Deep Sleep Mode

is

activated

and

deactivated

on

a

radio unit

using the FieldReplaceableUnit.activateDeepSleep

and

the FieldReplaceableUnit.deactivateDeepSleep MO actions.

Radio Deep Sleep Mode is activated and deactivated using the following MO actions:

- FieldReplaceableUnit.activateDeepSleep to activate Radio Deep Sleep Mode
- FieldReplaceableUnit.deactivateDeepSleep to deactivate Radio Deep Sleep Mode
- FieldReplaceableUnit.activateDeepSleepWithDuration to activate Radio Deep Sleep with pre-set time interval.

The FieldReplaceableUnit.deepSleepStatus attribute shows the deep

sleep status of a radio unit.

By default, the FieldReplaceableUnit.deepSleepStatus attribute is set

to NOT\_SUPPORTED for all radio units. If a radio unit supports Radio

Deep Sleep Mode, the FieldReplaceableUnit.deepSleepStatus attribute

automatically changes to DEACTIVATED.

Activation of Radio Deep Sleep Mode

To activate Radio Deep Sleep Mode, the following conditions must be fulfilled:

- All cells are locked on the radio unit.
- All sector carriers are locked on the radio unit.

The activation sequence is the following:

1. The FieldReplaceableUnit.activateDeepSleep action is performed on all Baseband units connected to the radio unit.
2. The FieldReplaceableUnit.deepSleepStatus attribute of the MO instance representing the radio unit changes to REQUESTED. The attribute value remains REQUESTED until all cells and sector carriers are locked on the radio unit.
3. If all conditions are fulfilled, the FieldReplaceableUnit.deepSleepStatus attribute changes to ACTIVATION\_IN\_PROGRESS.
4. When the activation finishes, the FieldReplaceableUnit.deepSleepStatus attribute changes to one of the following values: ACTIVATED if the activation is successful DEACTIVATED if the activation is unsuccessful Note: For information about the limitations of the Radio Deep Sleep Mode feature, see Dependencies of Radio Deep Sleep Mode.

Deactivation of Radio Deep Sleep Mode

The deactivation sequence is the following:

1. The FieldReplaceableUnit.deactivateDeepSleep action is performed on a Baseband unit connected to the radio unit.
2. The FieldReplaceableUnit.deepSleepStatus attribute of the MO instance representing the radio unit changes to DEACTIVATION\_IN\_PROGRESS.
3. When the deactivation finishes, the FieldReplaceableUnit.deepSleepStatus attribute changes to DEACTIVATED. The change is visible on all connected Baseband units. Note: The radio unit restarts during the deactivation of Radio Deep Sleep Mode. After the restart, locked cells and sector carriers must be unlocked to make them operational.

Radio Deep Sleep Mode deactivates if any of the following actions are performed:

- A power cycle is performed on a radio unit.
- A radio unit is restarted.
- A Baseband unit is restarted. Note: Restarting a Baseband unit restarts the connected radio units that are in Radio Deep Sleep Mode at the time.

Activation

Deep Sleep Mode with Time Duration

To activate Radio Deep Sleep Mode feature with preset time duration, the following

conditions must be fulfilled:

- All cells are locked on the radio unit.
- All sector carriers are locked on the radio unit.
- Once activated, the deep sleep cannot be interrupted by the RAN Compute unit or the operator through the network.

The activation sequence with the preset time duration is done according to the

following process:

1. The FieldReplaceableUnit.activateDeepSleepWithDuration MO action is performed on all Baseband units connected to the radio unit.
2. The value of the FieldReplaceableUnit.deepSleepStatus attribute of the MO instance that represents the radio unit changes to REQUESTED. The value of the attribute remains REQUESTED until all cells and sector carriers are locked on the radio unit.
3. If all conditions are fulfilled, the value of the FieldReplaceableUnit.deepSleepStatus attribute changes to ACTIVATION\_IN\_PROGRESS.
4. 4. When the activation finishes, the value of the FieldReplaceableUnit.deepSleepStatus attribute changes to one of the following values: ACTIVATED if the activation is successful. DEACTIVATED if the activation is unsuccessful.
5. The radio monitors the unit temperature during deep sleep and initiates wake-up if the unit temperature is outside the set thresholds.
6. 6. When the timer for deep sleep configured with the FieldReplaceableUnit.activateDeepSleepWithDuration attribute expires, deep sleep is deactivated automatically.

## 3.1 Activate and Deactivate Radio Deep Sleep Mode Using AMOS

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement enables the NR Booster Carrier Sleep feature to be supported

on CPRI-based radio units. The NR Booster Carrier Sleep feature allows overlaid

booster cells to detect low-traffic conditions and enter into cell sleep mode

automatically, saving energy. If all cells in the radio unit are in sleep mode, the

radio unit enters deep sleep mode, which further reduces energy consumption. Cell

sleep is based on a threshold of the total downlink PRB utilization and cell wake-up

is based on a timer that can be set using the

DESManagementFunction.periodicEsDuration attribute.

Capacity and Performance

This feature enhancement causes cells with low traffic to enter cell sleep mode and

radio units to enter deep sleep mode, saving energy. This feature enhancement can

also increase traffic in neighboring cells because the UEs are moved to them.

The capacity of the network decreases for each sleeping cell. Cell wake-up is based

on a timer and it also takes time for a waking cell to be fully operable.

Cell sleep and wake-up can temporarily reduce SINR for several seconds on other

activated carriers in the same radio unit.

The following PM counters can be used to monitor the energy saving enabled by this

feature enhancement:

- FieldReplaceableUnit.pmFruDeepSleepTime
- NRCellDU.pmCellSleepTimeEnergySaving

Operation

For tasks requiring the handling of the SectorEquipmentFunction MO

class, the cell is only set to ENABLED two minutes after the

SectorEquipmentFunction MO class is unlocked.

If the SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attribute is

reconfigured to refer to a new radio, the

FieldReplaceableUnit.deactivateDeepSleep attribute must be

manually configured on the previous sleeping radio unit.

Interfaces

No impact.

This feature enhancement is fully supported on the following non-AAS-capable radio

units:

- Radio 2251
