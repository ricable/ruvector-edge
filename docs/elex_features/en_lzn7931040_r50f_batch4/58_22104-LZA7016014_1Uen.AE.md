# 2 Dependencies of 16-QAM Uplink

This feature has no

dependencies or limitations.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No known limitations.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of 16-QAM Uplink

The higher modulation format enables more information to be transferred in each radio,

which results in a higher peak rate in good radio conditions.

The uplink peak rates are doubled by using 16 QAM modulation compared

to QPSK modulation.
