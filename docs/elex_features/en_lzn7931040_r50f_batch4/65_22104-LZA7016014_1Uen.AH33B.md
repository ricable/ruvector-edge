Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The following conditions must be met for the feature to be operable:

- The value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute must be equal to or lower than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute.
- The ARP configuration of emergency calls in the eNodeB must be aligned with the ARPs defined for emergency calls in the core network.
- The ARP configuration of emergency calls must be the same in the whole network, otherwise handovers might fail after the X2-S1 handover.

# 3 Feature Operation of Emergency Call Prioritization

This feature identifies emergency calls for prioritization.

Emergency calls are identified for prioritization based on the following information:

- For the initial connection setup for UEs in idle mode, the emergency calls are identified by a cause value in the RRC Connection Request message. This information is only valid until the first E-RAB is established.
- For the E-RAB establishment and the incoming handover for UEs already in connected mode, the emergency calls are identified based on a specific Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) value, which is received from the MME. The method of identification depends on the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute. If the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute is set to the default value of -1, calls are identified in the following ways: ARP levels higher than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideHpa attribute and equal to or less than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute are considered emergency calls. ARP levels equal to or less than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideHpa attribute are considered HPA calls. If the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute is set to a non-default value, calls are identified in the following ways: ARP levels equal to the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute are considered emergency calls. ARP levels equal to or less than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute, excluding the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute, are considered HPA calls.

In the case of an emergency call, the eNodeB ignores the received HRL for the UE. The UE is

handled as if no HRL is received, which means that no access restrictions apply to the UE.

# 4 Network Impact of Emergency Call Prioritization

This feature allows the prioritization of emergency calls.

Capacity and Performance

Emergency calls are prioritized over non-privileged calls during the following

processes:

- Initial access
- E-RAB establishment
- Incoming handover

Because of this, the HRL is ignored for emergency calls. This reduces the risk of

failed or blocked emergency calls in the network.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 6 Performance of Emergency Call Prioritization

This feature is associated with several PM counters.

Key Performance Indicators

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The following PM counters can be used to observe the E-RAB establishment success rate

for HPA and privileged access calls:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmErabEstabAttAddedHpa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmErabEstabAttAddedHpa
- EUtranCellFDD.pmErabEstabAttAddedPa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmErabEstabAttAddedPa
- EUtranCellFDD.pmErabEstabAttInitHpa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmErabEstabAttInitHpa
- EUtranCellFDD.pmErabEstabAttInitPa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmErabEstabAttInitPa
- EUtranCellFDD.pmErabEstabSuccAddedHpa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmErabEstabSuccAddedHpa
- EUtranCellFDD.pmErabEstabSuccAddedPa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmErabEstabSuccAddedPa
- EUtranCellFDD.pmErabEstabSuccInitHpa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmErabEstabSuccInitHpa
- EUtranCellFDD.pmErabEstabSuccInitPa
- EUtranCellTDD.pmErabEstabSuccInitPa

The number and the success rate of E-RAB establishment attempts for emergency calls

can be calculated by subtracting the value of an HPA PM counter from the value of

the corresponding privileged access PM counter.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Emergency Call Prioritization

The method of emergency call prioritization is based on the value of the

AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute.

A UE can be identified as being in an emergency call based on the following

attributes:

- AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc
- AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideHpa
- AdmissionControl.paArpOverride

If the value of the

AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute is set to the default

value of -1, calls are identified in the following ways:

- ARP levels higher than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideHpa attribute and equal to or less than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute are considered emergency calls.
- ARP levels equal to or less than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideHpa attribute are considered HPA calls.

If the value of the

AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute is set to a

non-default value, calls are identified in the following ways:

- ARP levels equal to the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute are considered emergency calls.
- ARP levels equal to or less than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute, excluding the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute, are considered HPA calls.

This way, a higher priority can be configured for emergency calls than for HPA calls.

During configuration, the following conditions must be met:

- If multiple ARPs are defined for emergency calls in an existing configuration, and these must not be changed, the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute must be kept as the default value of -1.
- The value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute must be equal to or lower than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute.
- The ARP configuration of emergency calls in the eNodeB must be aligned with the ARPs defined for emergency calls in the core network.
- The ARP configuration of emergency calls must be the same in the whole network, otherwise handovers might fail after the X2-S1 handover.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 25.Q2.0: Flexible Emergency ARP Configuration

This feature enhancement provides an option to configure the Allocation and Retention

Priority (ARP) for emergency calls and HPA separately.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                        |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces the

AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute, which enables the

interpretation of ARP levels as emergency calls independently. With this feature

enhancement, emergency calls can have a higher priority level than HPA calls.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the

AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute to provide an

alternative way to configure the interpretation of emergency calls.

The default value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc

attribute is -1. If the attribute is set to the default value,

emergency calls are identified in the existing way.

If the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute is

set to a non-default value, emergency calls and HPA calls are identified in the

following way:

- The eNodeB interprets ARP levels equal to the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute as emergency calls.
- The eNodeB interprets ARP levels equal to or less than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride as HPA calls, excluding the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute.

The AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideHpa and the

AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attributes are also updated to

support this configuration.

With this feature enhancement, the following conditions must be met for the Emergency Call Prioritization feature to be

operable:

- If multiple ARPs are defined for emergency calls in the existing configuration, and these must not be changed, the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute must be kept as the default value of -1.
- The value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverrideEc attribute must be equal to or lower than the value of the AdmissionControl.paArpOverride attribute.
- The ARP configuration of emergency calls in the eNodeB must be aligned with the ARPs defined for emergency calls in the core network.
- The ARP configuration of emergency calls must be the same in the whole network, otherwise handovers might fail after the X2-S1 handover.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

Without the Release Independence Manager application, this feature enhancement

requires ENM version 25.1 or later. The Release Independence

Manager application also supports the feature enhancement on earlier supported ENM

versions.
