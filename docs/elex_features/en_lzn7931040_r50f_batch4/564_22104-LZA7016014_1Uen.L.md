Summary

UEs with capabilities exceeding the maximum allowed PDCP Service Data Unit (SDU) size must

reduce UE capability information to fit it into one

UECapabilityInformation message. This feature allows UEs that

support the segmentation mechanism described in 3GPP 36.331 release 16

to send their complete capability information to the eNodeB in segments. The eNodeB

merges these message segments and uses complete capabilities to select appropriate

configurations for the UE.

Using the feature has the following benefits:

- UEs capable of UL segmentation are able to send complete capabilities regardless of their size.
- The capability information message is not limited by the maximum PDCP SDU size.

Additional Information

36.331.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The eNodeB can receive up to 16 segments. However, because of memory constraints, it

can process only up to six segments. When the eNodeB successfully reassembles the

UECapabilityInformation message from the received

ULDedicatedMessageSegment messages, the

RRC\_UL\_DEDICATED\_MESSAGE\_SEGMENT PM event is reported.

If the UECapabilityInformation message is joined from six or fewer

segments, then it is processed without change. If the message consists of more than

six segments, then it is discarded and a new UECapabilityEnquiry

message is sent without including the rrc-SegAllowed-r16 IE. Further

processing follows as if segmentation is not applied.

Network Requirements

To fully benefit from this feature, the node requires support from the following

network elements:

- UEs must support uplink segmentation, as described in 3GPP TS 36.331 release 16 or higher.
- It is recommended to use ENM version 22.3 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions as well.

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE Uplink RRC Message Segmentation

The

feature allows UEs capable of uplink segmentation to send complete UE capability information

in 2-16 separate UECapabilityInformation message segments, unlimited by the

maximum PDCP Service Data Unit (SDU) size. The eNodeB receives and merges the

UECapabilityInformation message segments, and uses the complete

capabilities to select appropriate configurations for the UE. The feature allows UEs to send

capabilities larger than the supported size through uplink RRC message

segmentation.

UEs that support the segmentation mechanism described in 3GPP 36.331 release

16 can divide their UE capability information into parts and send them in 2-16 separate

UlDedicatedMessageSegment messages to the eNodeB. The eNodeB stores

these UlDedicatedMessageSegment message segments and reassembles them

into one UECapabilityInformation message, which is then further

processed.

The feature introduces the RRC\_UL\_DEDICATED\_MESSAGE\_SEGMENT PM event.

Operational Process

1. The eNodeB sends the UECapabilityEnquiry message, including the rrc-SegAllowed-r16 IE.
2. The UE receives the UECapabilityEnquiry.
    1. UEs that support uplink segmentation send the full capability information to the eNodeB in segments. If the UECapabilityInformation message size fits into the maximum allowed PDU size, the UE sends the message unchanged.
    2. UEs that do not support uplink segmentation send their capability information in one UECapabilityInformation message. If the size capability exceeds the maximum allowed PDCP SDU size, then the UE capability information is reduced to fit into one UECapabilityInformation message.
3. The eNodeB receives the UE capability information.
    1. The eNodeB recognizes and handles the UlDedicatedMessageSegment messages sent by the UEs that support segmentation.

# 4 Network Impact of LTE Uplink RRC Message Segmentation

More UE messages are expected to be sent to the eNodeB because of the segmentation

mechanism. The feature introduces an information element in the

UECapabilityEnquiry

message.

Capacity and Performance

As this feature allows UEs that support the segmentation mechanism described in

3GPP 36.331 release 16 to send their complete capability

information to the eNodeB in segments, the number of UE messages is expected to

increase. This can result in prolonged attach

time.

The RRC UE capability enquiry procedure measures the time between

UECapabilityEnquiry and the

UECapabilityInformation messages. If the LTE Uplink RRC Message

Segmentation feature is activated, the additional messages and the reassembly of the

segments increase the time between the two messages. This results in higher median

latency. Therefore, when the LTE Uplink RRC Message Segmentation feature is

activated, the RRC UE capability enquiry latency procedure replaces the RRC UE

capability enquiry procedure. The UE capability enquiry latency procedure measures

the time between the UECapabilityEnquiry and the

UECapabilityInformation messages or between the

UECapabilityEnquiry and the first

UlDedicatedMessageSegment messages.

Interfaces

This

feature introduces the rrc-SegAllowed-r16 IE in the

UECapabilityEnquiry message.

The eNodeB recognizes and handles the UlDedicatedMessageSegment

messages sent by the UEs that support

segmentation.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
