# 1 Basic Admission Control Overview

The purpose of Basic Admission Control is to accept or reject admission for UEs and

E-RABs, so the requested Quality of Service can be maintained for all previously admitted

and admission seeking UEs and E-RABs.

Summary

The Basic Admission Control feature can be configured to reserve a share of system resources

to be used only for privileged access, for example, emergency calls. By reserving

system resources, the accessibility and mobility success rate increases for UEs and

bearers assigned with privileged access.

The following types of admission control are defined in the LTE basic system:

- Emergency Call Prioritization
- Transport Network Admission Control

# 3 Feature Operation of Basic Admission Control

The RBS can receive the resource requests in the following ways:

- RRC Connection Establishment requests
- Initial Context Setup requests
- Handover requests
- E-RAB setup or modification request

For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.331, 3GPP TS 36.413,

3GPP TS 36.423. Also, see information about the Radio Bearer Service feature.

The Basic Admission Control feature has the following functions:

- Monitored system resources are considered before a request admission.
- Admission thresholds are used to decide if a request can be admitted.
- Emergency Call Prioritization function reserves resources for privileged calls.
- To protect bearer QoS and bearers already admitted, transport network admission control introduces admission thresholds.
- Resources can be configured to favor privileged bearers. Depending on eNodeB capacity, the number of bearers is tracked.
- Resources can be configured to favor privileged UEs. Depending on eNodeB capacity, the number of UEs is tracked.

## 3.1 Monitored System Resources

RBS considers its MSRs to decide if it can admit a request or not, see Figure 1. Each MSR represents the utilization of a

system resource that potentially is a bottleneck in the RBS. Moreover, the MSR represents the

accumulated resource utilization from all admitted requests.

Figure 1   Admission Control Checks the MSRs

The MSRs can be either static or dynamic, see Figure 2. Requests can be admitted (indicated as up)

and released (indicated as down). The resource consumption to a static MSR because of an

admitted request does not vary during the time the request is served by the RBS. The resource

consumption changes if a specific modification request, for example an E-RAB Modify Request on

S1AP, is issued. The resource consumption to a dynamic MSR because of an admitted request can

vary during the time the request is served by the RBS. The variations depend on the scheduler,

radio conditions, or mobility.

Consideration of dynamic MSRs for GBR traffic is part of the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature and protects QoS of already

admitted E-RABs.

Figure 2   Static versus Dynamic MSRs

## 3.2 Admission Threshold

Admission Threshold

The Basic Admission Control feature considers MSR utilization in the following way:

- When utilization is lower than the admission threshold the request is admitted.
- When utilization is not lower than the admission threshold, the request is rejected, as shown in Figure 3.

The admission threshold can be expressed as a percentage of the maximum capacity

associated with the MSR.

Figure 3   Admission Threshold

With differentiated admission control two threshold levels are used, see Differentiated Admission Control and Dynamic GBR Admission Control for more details.

Admission Threshold Values

The value of the admission threshold depends on the following characteristics of the request

and of the MSR:

- Initial access or handover
- Static or dynamic MSR
- QCI (indicating resource type GBR or non-GBR)
- Privileged access, see Emergency Call Prioritization

Setting admission thresholds for dynamic resources allows for creating a headroom between

the thresholds and the maximum capacity for fluctuations due to changing radio environment

and mobility, as explained in Dynamic GBR Admission Control. Whether and how the admission

thresholds are configurable is explained for each specific MSR, see Dynamic GBR Admission Control. The maximum capacity is specific

to the MSR and is generally not configurable unless indicated. The core network controls

the QoS by selecting the QCI. For more information, see 3GPP (TS)

23.203.

## 3.3 Basic Admission Control Execution

The Basic Admission Control feature executes in two steps.

1. There is a check if the admission threshold of any MSR is exceeded.
2. Depending on the result, the following can happen:
    - If no admission threshold is exceeded, the request is granted.
    - If an admission threshold is exceeded, there can be a check for an opportunity of pre-emption of already allocated resources, as explained in Differentiated Admission Control, if pre-emption in the Differentiated Admission Control feature is enabled.

## 3.4 Privileged Access User

Privileged Access (PA) user has priority access to the system resources compared to a

non-PA user by reserving a share of RBS system resources.

Privileged access is considered for the following system resource types:

- UE context level
- Radio bearer level

Emergency Call Prioritization

## 3.5 Emergency Call Prioritization

Emergency calls are prioritized by using dedicated resources in admission control

during initial access, E-RAB establishment, and incoming handover.

To enable emergency call prioritization, the Basic Admission Control feature can be

configured to reserve a share of RBS system resources. This is used for privileged access to

increase accessibility and mobility success rate. This means that the admission threshold for

privileged access is higher compared to non-privileged access.

## 3.6 SR Resource Reservation by Preallocation

If there are contentions for SR resources, the acceptance of more privileged access (PA)

users over non-privileged access users is ensured.  Reservation of SR resources enables

allowing PA users to connect if there are no free SR resources. If there are no free SR

resources, the following method can be used for connecting PA users:

- PA users are able to use reserved resources allocated to them.

Pool reserved for PA users can consist of one or both of the dedicated pools which

reserve resources on cell level:

- Preallocated pool
- Limitation pool

Preallocated Pool

The preallocated pool ensures that there are available SR resources for the PA users

when the BBM limits for SR resources are reached. The SR resources in the

preallocated pool are physically preallocated and dedicated to this pool. As a

result, releasing SR resources used by non-PA users does not increase the number of

free SR resources in the preallocated pool.

If preallocated pool is activated, the number of SR resources equal to the

AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnReservationsPerCell attribute is

preallocated in each cell at activation. The preallocated resources are freed at

cell deactivation.

If there are no SR resources allowed for non-PA users, then such situation is a

configuration fault.

Limitation Pool

The limitation pool ensures that there are SR resources available for incoming PA

users during SR resource exhaustion on cell level.

The limitation pool consists of several SR resources reserved only for PA users from

the total number of SR resources available in a cell. These resources are allocated

only when requested by an incoming PA user.

The SR resources in the limitation pool that are used by PA users can be replaced by

SR resources released by non-PA users. When an SR resource used by a non-PA user is

released and there are SR resources from the limitation pool used by PA users, the

SR resource of the released non-PA user becomes a part of the limitation pool.

In addition, SR resources from the limitation pool used by PA user become part of

the ordinary pool, so that the size of the limitation pool is always kept the

same.

If the number of unallocated SR resources in the cell is less or equal to the value

of the AdmissionControl.limitSrNonPa attribute, only PA users are

allowed to allocate them. Non-PA users are rejected.

The limitation pool covers only the exhaustion of the SR resources cell limits.

Exhaustion of BBM limits can occur before cell limits are reached, and this

situation is not covered within the limitation pool.

SR Resource Allocation

SR resources are allocated in the following ways:

- Normally SR resources are allocated to both non-PA and PA users until the regular pool is exhausted.
- If there are no free SR resources from the regular pool: The PA users are allocated SR resources reserved for PA users by limitation on cell level (if limitation pool is activated). Non-PA users are rejected.
- If there are no free SR resources from the regular and limitation pool or there are no free SR resources in the regular pool and the limitation pool is deactivated, the following apply: PA users are able to use preallocated SR resources if the preallocated pool is activated. Non-PA users are rejected.
- If there are no free SR resources on baseband level (even if limit on cell level is not reached), the following apply: The PA users can use the SR resources preallocated for PA users if the preallocated pool is activated. Non-PA users are rejected.
- If there are no free SR resources from the activated pools (regular, limitation, and preallocated pool), all users are rejected.

Preallocation of SR Resources

The pool of preallocated SR resources reserved for PA users is activated if the

following conditions are met:

- The AdmissionControl.resourceReservationForPAState attribute is set to ACTIVATED.
- The AdmissionControl.srBbmPaUsersPreallocation attribute is set to TRUE.
- The AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnReservationsPerCell attribute is greater than 0.

For the successful preallocation of PUCCH SR resources in a cell, the prerequisite is

that the baseband limits for PUCCH SR resources are not reached at the time of cell

setup.

At partly successful preallocation, only those SR resources are preallocated that are

available on baseband level at the time of cell activation.

If preallocation is not successful, the system works as if the preallocated pool is

deactivated.

To correct an unsuccessful preallocation of PUCCH SR resources, the cell needs to be

locked and unlocked when the load is not exhausting baseband limits of PUCCH SR

resources. The number of successfully preallocated SR resources in a cell can be

read from the read-only EUtranCellFDD.nrOfPreallocatedSrRes or

EUtranCellTDD.nrOfPreallocatedSrRes attributes.

The total number of available SR resources in each cell set by the

EutranCellFDD.noOfPucchSrUsers or

EutranCellTDD.noOfPucchSrUsers attributes must be higher than

the size of the preallocated pool set by the

AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnReservationsPerCell attribute.

The capacity of non-PA users for RRC connected users is reduced by the setting of SR

resources reserved for PA users for each cell multiplied with the number of

cells.

SR Resources from the Limitation Pool

The limitation pool is activated if the following conditions are met:

- The AdmissionControl.resourceReservationForPAState attribute is set to ACTIVATED.
- The value of the AdmissionControl.limitSrNonPa attribute is greater than 0.

If the limitation pool is activated, several SR resources equal to the value of the

AdmissionControl.limitSrNonPa attribute are reserved in each

cell.

If the total number of available SR resources in any cell set by the

EutranCellFDD.noOfPucchSrUsers or

EutranCellTDD.noOfPucchSrUsers attributes is set to a lower

value than the value of the AdmissionControl.limitSrNonPa

attribute, the limitation pool is disabled in the cell.

If the number of unallocated SR resources in the cell is less or equal to the value

of the AdmissionControl.limitSrNonPa attribute, only PA users are

allowed to allocate them, while non-PA users are rejected.

## 3.7 Transport Network Admission Control

For each E-RAB request of resource type GBR there is an E-RAB GBR downlink or uplink IE

associated, see 3GPP TS 36.413  and 3GPP TS 36.423. The transport

network admission control function introduces admission thresholds for accumulated values of

E-RAB GBR of admitted E-RABs for downlink and uplink separately to secure the following:

- The admitted GBR bearers receive acceptable QoS.
- The GBR bearers that are already admitted in the system are protected.

The accumulated GBR of admitted E-RABs correspond to static MSRs, for which the admission

thresholds for handover and initial access are the same.

Figure 6   Principles of Transport Network Admission Control

The admission thresholds for privileged access GBR traffic are the transport network

bandwidths AdmissionControl.dlTransNwBandwidth and

AdmissionControl.ulTransNwBandwidth (downlink and uplink). These

correspond to the maximum bandwidth shown in Figure 6.

The admission thresholds for non-privileged access GBR traffic can be configured for

transport network resources. The configuration is done as follows:

- The transport network bandwidth is configured using the AdmissionControl.dlTransNwBandwidth and AdmissionControl.ulTransNwBandwidth parameters.
- The admission thresholds are defined by the AdmissionControl.dlNonPaGbrTn and AdmissionControl.ulNonPaGbrTn parameters.

## 3.8 Bearer Admission Control

For a bearer that is considered for privileged access, reserved resources can be configured

so accessibility for privileged access is higher.

The MSRs of Bearer Admission Control in LTE basic system are the transport network resources

described in transport network admission control and number of established radio bearers.

Transport Network Admission Control

Privileged Access User

## 3.9 Number of Established Radio Bearers

The static MSR for number of established radio bearers keeps track of the number of

established radio bearers (SRBs and DRBs). When a bearer is established, the MSR value

is increased by one and when a bearer is released the MSR value is decreased by one. The

maximum level for this MSR corresponds to the capacity of the eNodeB. The admission

thresholds for handover and initial access are the same. Reservation for privileged

access is considered according to the parameter

AdmissionControl.resourceReservationForPAState.

## 3.10 Radio Bearers Admission with Preventive Preemption

Preventive preemption increases privileged access (PA) RB admission success

rate.

When PA DRB requests and PA pool have free resources, the resources are admitted without

triggering preemption and this allows the PA pool to become full.

When the PA pool is full, the following apply:

- The PA DRB resource requests are rejected, and the legacy behavior triggers preemption.
- If HPA user requests resource, PA SRB is rejected and the user does not get the requested resource.
- If PA SRB resource request is rejected without triggering preemption, the PA DRB resource requests cannot trigger preemption.

Preventive preemption implements the following solutions to these issues:

- Admits SRB of the PA user in preventive preemption pool to get through to the PA DRB to start preemption procedure if it has authority to preempt.
- Introduces UE-level preemption whenever the PA DRB is admitted to the PA pool.
- Introduces UE-level preemption whenever the initial context setup PA DRB is rejected when no PA pool is available.
- Introduces AdmissionControl.nrOfPrevPreempPaRbReservation attribute that defines the number of PA radio bearers that can be allocated in the preventive preemption pool.
- Introducing UE-level preemption, where the system aims to never exceed the limit of free bearers and to secure free bearers to admit SRB of the PA user in the future. Note: The preventive preemption pool can be used only for initial context setup UE. In this case, SRB of handover or reestablishment UEs cannot be allocated in preventive preemption pool regardless of the PA type. If the PA pool is full and only the preventive preemption pool is available, handover and reestablishment are rejected because of SRB allocation failure. The maximum number of free bearers can be reached, when there are no more bearers that require preventive preemption.

## 3.11 UE Admission Control

For a UE that is considered for privileged access, reserved resources can be configured so

accessibility for privileged access is higher.

The MSRs of UE Admission Control in LTE basic system are related to number of RRC Connected

Users.

The admission thresholds for handover and initial access are the same. Reservation for

privileged access is considered according to the attribute

AdmissionControl.resourceReservationForPAState for the number of RRC

connected users on eNodeB level as well as for the PUCCH SR resources on cell level and eNodeB

level. The amount of resources reserved for privileged access is configurable using the

attribute AdmissionControl.nrOfPaConnReservationsPerCell.

Privileged Access User

## 3.12 Number of RRC Connected Users

The static MSRs for number of RRC connected users keeps track of the number of UEs

admitted to the eNodeB. When a UE is admitted, the MSR value is increased by one and

when a UE is released, the MSR value is decreased by one. The maximum level for this MSR

corresponds to the following:

- The licensed capacity with respect to RRC connected users for the eNodeB
- The number of scheduling request resources on PUCCH for each cell, see Scheduler

# 4 Network Impact of Basic Admission Control

The Basic Admission Control feature can be configured to have a favorable impact on

privileged access.

Capacity and Performance

The Basic Admission Control feature can be configured to reserve resources for

privileged access. If configured, capacity for non-privileged access is reduced

accordingly.

Handover

The Basic Admission Control feature can be configured to reserve resources for

privileged access. This makes handover success rates higher for privileged access

compared to non-privileged access.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Basic Admission Control

Basic Admission Control parameters can be configured for privileged and non-privileged

access.

The ARP, which is configured for privileged access in the RBS by

AdmissionControl.paArpOverride parameter, must be aligned with the core

network view on which ARP is to be used for privileged access.

Privileged Access for Emergency Call Prioritization

To activate system resources for privileged access to be used by Emergency Call

Prioritization, the AdmissionControl.resourceReservationForPAState

parameter must be configured.

Thresholds for Transport Network Admission Control

The admission thresholds for privileged GBR admission are the transport network bandwidths

and can be calculated with the following formulas:

| Downlink threshold (privileged GBR admission)   |    | dlTransNwBandwidth × 1 Mbps   |
|-------------------------------------------------|----|-------------------------------|
|                                                 |    |                               |
| Uplink threshold (privileged GBR admission)     |    | ulTransNwBandwidth × 1 Mbps   |

The configured transport network bandwidth must correspond to the actual capacity,

otherwise the link can be congested with GBR traffic. By changing the parameter values, it

is possible to adjust the size of the transport network bandwidth, which is reserved for the

GBR part. The remaining bandwidth is for the non-GBR part.

The admission thresholds for non-privileged access GBR traffic can be configured for

transport network resources. The configuration is done in two steps.

1. The transport network bandwidth is configured using the AdmissionControl.dlTransNwBandwidth and AdmissionControl.ulTransNwBandwidth parameters.
2. The admission thresholds are defined by the AdmissionControl.dlNonPaGbrTn and AdmissionControl.ulNonPaGbrTn parameters.

The admission thresholds for non-privileged GBR admission can be calculated with the

following formulas:

| Downlink threshold (non-privileged GBR admission)   |    | dlTransNwBandwidth × 1 Mbps × (dlNonPaGbrTn / 1000)                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                     |    |                                                                        |
| Uplink threshold (non-privileged GBR admission)     |    | Uplink threshold = ulTransNwBandwidth × 1 Mbps × (ulNonPaGbrTn / 1000) |

The reserving of GBR resources can be adjusted for each QCI, if the Dynamic GBR Admission Control feature is activated,

using the QciProfileOperatorDefined.qciAcTuning parameter.

## Appendix A.a: 19.Q4: Transport Network Admission Control for Baseband Radio Node

The transport network admission control function is introduced for Baseband and

updated for DU Radio Nodes.

Benefits

The transport network admission control function enables differentiating E-RABs of

resource type GBR. Thus the availability of emergency and privileged access calls is

ensured even when non-privileged access calls are denied in narrowband transport

networks. The function introduces admission thresholds for accumulated values of

E-RAB GBR of admitted E-RABs for downlink and uplink separately to secure the

following:

- Admitted GBR bearers receive acceptable QoS.
- Protect the GBR bearers already admitted in the system.

The accumulated GBR of admitted E-RABs corresponds to the static MSRs, for which the

admission thresholds for handover and initial access are the same.

Capacity and Performance

The transport network admission control function has the following benefits:

- Initial and added E-RAB success rate is higher for privileged access compared to non-privileged access.
- Mobility success rate is higher for privileged access compared to non-privileged access.

The operation of the transport network admission control function can be observed

with the following counters:

- pmErabEstabFailGbrDlEnb
- pmErabEstabFailGbrUlEnb

The operation of the transport network admission control function can be observed

with the following events.

Operation

The admission thresholds for privileged access GBR traffic are the transport network

bandwidths AdmissionControl.dlTransNwBandwidth attribute for

downlink and AdmissionControl.ulTransNwBandwidth attribute for

uplink, calculated according to the following:

- Downlink threshold = dlTransNwBandwidth × 1 Mbps
- Uplink threshold = ulTransNwBandwidth × 1 Mbps

The admission thresholds for non-privileged access GBR traffic can be calculated

according to the following:

- Downlink threshold = dlTransNwBandwidth × 1 Mbps × (dlNonPaGbrTn / 1000)
- Uplink threshold = ulTransNwBandwidth × 1 Mbps × (ulNonPaGbrTn / 1000)

At the first start of the Baseband, the value of the

AdmissionControl.dlTransNwBandwidth and the

AdmissionControl.ulTransNwBandwidth attributes is set to the

default 1000 Mbps, but for software upgrade of the Baseband node, the value is set

to 2000 Mbps. The attributes must be configured according to capacity of TN

port.

The tnac CLI command is introduced for Baseband nodes. It shows

configured downlink and uplink admission thresholds for accumulated values of E-RAB

GBR, for both privileged access and non-privileged access. Further, this CLI command

shows admitted GBR data for each node and for each cell.
