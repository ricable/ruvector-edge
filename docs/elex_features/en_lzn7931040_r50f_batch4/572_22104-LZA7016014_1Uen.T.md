Summary

The Optical Indicator Control feature allows the immediate activation and deactivation of

optical indicators on all or specific radio units in a node. The feature also

introduces an action to temporarily activate the optical indicators on a specific

radio unit.

Deactivating the optical indicators turns off all optical indicators on radio units

regardless of other settings. Activating the optical indicators restores the correct

optical indicator states.

Deactivated optical indicators makes radio units less visible in the dark.

# 3 Feature Operation of Optical Indicator Control

The Optical Indicator Control feature uses MO attributes to activate and deactivate

optical indicators on radio units.

Controlling Optical Indicators

The OpticalIndicatorControl.opticalIndicatorControl attribute

controls the optical indicators on all radio units in the node. The attribute has

the following values:

| ACTIVATED   |    | This is the default value of the attribute. Optical indicators work                                 normally.   |
|-------------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|             |    |                                                                                                                 |
| DEACTIVATED |    | Optical indicators are turned off.                                                                              |

The FieldReplaceableUnit.unitOpticalIndicatorControl attribute

controls the optical indicators on a specific radio unit. The attribute has the

following values:

| NOT_SET     |    | This is the default value of the attribute. When the                                     OpticalIndicatorControl MO class exists,                                 optical indicator states are determined by the                                     OpticalIndicatorControl.opticalIndicatorControl                                 attribute.   |

Activating Optical Indicators Temporarily

The FieldReplaceableUnit.activateOpticalIndicators action

temporarily activates the optical indicators on a specific radio unit. When the time

period specified by the action ends, optical indicator state is resumed according to

the settings on radio unit and node level.

Using the action again while optical indicators are temporarily activated overrides

the specified time period. This allows for increasing or decreasing the time period

of temporary activation.

The temporary activation of optical indicators is cancelled under the following

conditions:

- The OpticalIndicatorControl MO class is created, and the value of the FieldReplaceableUnit.unitOpticalIndicatorControl attribute is NOT\_SET.
- The OpticalIndicatorControl MO class is deleted, and the value of the FieldReplaceableUnit.unitOpticalIndicatorControl attribute is NOT\_SET.
- The value of the OpticalIndicatorControl.opticalIndicatorControl attribute changes, and the value of the FieldReplaceableUnit.unitOpticalIndicatorControl attribute is NOT\_SET.
- The value of the FieldReplaceableUnit.unitOpticalIndicatorControl attribute changes.
- The FieldReplaceableUnit.activateOpticalIndicators action is used with the value of zero.
- The radio unit restarts.
- The node restarts.

Checking Optical Indicator States on a Radio Unit

The FieldReplaceableUnit.unitOpticalIndicatorCtrlStatus attribute

shows optical indicator states on a specific radio unit. The attribute has the

following values:

Table 2   Optical Indicator States on a Radio Unit

| Attribute value         | Optical Indicator State                                                                                        |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NOT_AVAILABLE           | The radio unit does not support the Optical Indicator Control                                         feature. |
| ACTIVATED               | Optical indicators work normally.                                                                              |
| ACTIVATED_WITH_DURATION | Optical indicators work normally for a time period.                                                            |
| DEACTIVATED             | Optical indicators are turned off.                                                                             |

In Mixed Mode Radio configurations, the value of the

FieldReplaceableUnit.unitOpticalIndicatorCtrlStatus attribute

might differ from the settings on node and radio unit level. For more details, see

Engineering Guidelines for Optical Indicator Control.

## 3.1 Optical Indicator States at Radio Unit Restart

The configured optical indicator states are lost when a radio unit restarts, and

restored when it reconnects to the node.

When a radio unit restarts, the optical indicators revert to the default state. This has

the following effects:

- Deactivated optical indicators become activated.
- The temporary activation of optical indicators is cancelled.

When the radio unit reconnects to the node, the configured optical indicator states are

resumed.

# 4 Network Impact of Optical Indicator Control

The Optical Indicator Control feature has no network impact.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Optical Indicator Control

The Optical Indicator Control feature introduces new parameters for configuring

optical indicator states on the node and radio unit level.

Table 3   Parameters

| Parameter                                           | Type       | Description          |
|-----------------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| OpticalIndicatorControl.opticalIndicatorControl     | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| FieldReplaceableUnit.unitOpticalIndicatorControl    | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| FieldReplaceableUnit.unitOpticalIndicatorCtrlStatus | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of Optical Indicator Control

The Optical Indicator Control feature has no associated KPIs, counters, or

events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Optical Indicator Control

In Mixed Mode Radio configurations, it is recommended to have the same optical

indicator settings on both nodes.

Optical Indicator Control in Mixed Mode Radio Configurations

In Mixed Mode Radio configurations, one node supporting the Optical Indicator Control

feature is sufficient.

When both nodes support the Optical Indicator Control feature, it is recommended to

set the value of the

FieldReplaceableUnit.unitOpticalIndicatorControl attribute to

ACTIVATED or DEACTIVATED on both nodes. This

is because optical indicator states are not synchronized between nodes.
