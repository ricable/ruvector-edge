Summary

Remote antenna tilt means that fewer site visits and mast climbs are required. Remote control

and supervision of antenna systems make optimization more effective. Antenna Line

Device refers to a physical tower top-mounted device, such as a TMA or RET unit,

that incorporates digital remote control and monitoring facilities.

The RET Support feature is supported by AISG 3.0. AISG defines open specifications

for the interface of these devices to control infrastructure and to ensure basic

interoperability of antennas.

A RET unit compliant with 3GPP Iuant interface (AISG v2) within the antenna system accepts

tilt commands only if the RET unit is configured. RET Configuration enables the RBS

to send configuration data to installed RET units through their Iuant interface.

This feature impacts the operation of unconfigured RET units, and thus affects the resulting

network coverage area.

# 3 Feature Operation of RET Support

The RET Support feature provides 3GPP compliant support for managing RET antenna in

the RAN.

Antenna tilting is a key method to ensure high capacity by limiting interference. Changes

to the antenna tilt are required during initial tuning. Recalculating antenna tilt is

part of mature network management.

Antennas in operating networks need regular adjustment because of the following

factors:

- Increased traffic loads
- New fill-in sites with an impact on up to 10 neighbor sectors
- Unpredictable phenomenons, such as heavy storms

The RET unit is able to adjust the electrical tilt angle of the variable tilt antenna

through electro-mechanical actuators (such as a stepper motor). The RET unit receives

tilt commands over the Iuant interface (coaxial cables) and moves the tilt actuator

accordingly.

The RET unit must be configured to translate the requested tilt, specified in degrees,

into stepper motor control signals appropriate for the connected antenna. This

translation or configuration data is stored in the RET unit. The file format of the

configuration data is vendor-specific.

Third-party RET units supplied separately from the antenna are configured with

configuration data supplied by the antenna vendor, and is specific to the antenna

type.

The RET unit is separate from the antenna to allow initial rollout with or without RET. A

RET unit can be retrofitted easily in the field.

When the MALD is configured, the RET unit can be connected by

more than one primary node, and the electrical tilting requires proper MALD authority.

For more information about MALD, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

3GPP Iuant (AISG v2) Interface

The AISG v2 specifications adopted by 3GPP define the 3GPP Iuant (AISG v2) interface

allowing communications between the RBS and the ALD (Antenna Line

Device) over the coaxial feeder cables.

The 3GPP Iuant (AISG v2) interface is used to communicate with the compatible RET

unit to allow the remote control of the antenna variable electrical tilt through the

RBS Element Manager or the Network Management System. The 3GPP Iuant (AISG v2)

interface is also used to monitor alarms and to configure the RET by uploading the

antenna configuration file.

## 3.1 Mechanical and Electrical Antenna Tilt

The tilt of antenna units can be changed manually or automatically.

Antennas can have the following tilt mechanisms:

- Fixed down tilt angle (mechanical tilt)
- Adjustable electrical down tilt angle (electrical tilt)

Figure 2   Mechanical and Electrical Tilt

The electrical down tilt antennas can be adjusted in the following ways:

- Manually by adjusting the phase-shifter on the antenna, requiring a site visit and antenna tower climbing
- Automatically through RET

The RET unit is easily fastened to the antenna by tightening the RET nut to the antenna RET

interface. Dismantling of the antenna is not required.

The RET unit can be mounted on any antenna with tilting capability, regardless of height,

gain, or band.

The RET unit communicates over an RS-485 interface, regardless if it is connected to a TMA,

an RIU, or an RRU.

(1)  Interface towards a Remote Electrical Tilt

antenna(2)  Also called Bias-Tee(3) RRUL 11 does

not support RET cascading

Figure 3 shows the types of RET

configurations:

Figure 3   Examples of RET Configurations

RETs can also be configured in a cascade chain that allows one RRU to control several RETs.

For more information, see Cascaded RET Support.

The RET field installation is performed without removing the antenna. When the system is

operational, the RET can be accessed through the following systems:

- RBS Element Manager
- Network Management System

Like the RBS Element Manager, the Network Management System has built-in functions allowing

monitoring and changes to individual sectors.

The Network Management System can also control a group of sectors or sites forming a cluster.

In this way, the tilt angles of an entire antenna cluster can be changed with a single

command.

## 3.4 RET Configuration

RET configuration is a one time process of loading configuration data to the RET units

persistent storage.

The RET unit can only accept tilt commands after it is configured. The configuration data

provides the relation between the tilt angle, specified in degrees, and the mechanical

actuator control required by the variable tilt antenna. Therefore, configuration data is

specific to the RET and the antenna to which the RET is connected.

Some RET units can be supplied preconfigured, particularly if the RET unit is delivered

factory-installed onto an antenna or integrated inside the antenna. If the RET unit is

supplied without configuration data loaded, the operator must perform the specific procedure

required to transfer the configuration data to the RET unit. Configuration data can be

provided by the antenna supplier in the form of a data file particular to the specific

antenna.

For more information about RET hardware elements used for software configurations, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

## 3.5 Power Consumption

The RET Support feature increases the power consumption, especially during

tilting.

Table 5 shows the maximum power

consumption for a RET unit defined in 3GPP TS 25.461.

Table 5   RET Power Consumption

| Operational state        | Power Consumption   |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Idle mode                | <2 W                |
| During tilting procedure | <13 W               |

## 3.6 O&amp;M Information

The RET Support feature enables the adjustment of 3GPP compliant antennas from a remote

location, such as an OMC.

The 3GPP-compatible RET antenna support is implemented in both the RBS and the Network

Management System. Therefore, antennas connected to the RBS can be adjusted from the OMC. The

Network Management System implements functions to let the operator configure the electrical

tilt of the RET.

For information about how the RET software can be remotely upgraded, see Firmware Download of Antenna Line Devices.

A RET can be supervised and is modeled on the management interface with its own objects. It

has alarms and its status can be observed. Faults reported by the Iuant compliant RET unit are

handled by the system and reported to the operator.

# 4 Network Impact of RET Support

The feature can reduce interference and improve cell coverage.

Capacity and Performance

The feature limits interference to ensure higher network capacity. RET products

enable the operator optimization possibilities to achieve a more efficient

network.

The coverage area for a cell can be adjusted without a site visit and antenna tower

climbing. The operator can obtain the preferred tilting without reduced coverage or

dropped calls.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters of RET Support

The feature introduces parameters for controlling the remote electrical antenna tilting

and device scans.

capability.

# 6 Performance of RET Support

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for RET Support

## 8.1 Configure RET Support for Remote Radio Units and AIR

RET can be configured by uploading configuration files into the RET unit.

Configuration of the RET unit is usually a one-time event and takes place during the

commissioning of the cell site. When the operator initiates the action, the RBS

configures (or reconfigures) installed RET units. The RBS uploads the configuration

file into the RET unit using the interface procedures specified in the 3GPP Iuant

standard. The antenna configuration file is transparently uploaded into the RET

unit, since the RBS does not validate the antenna configuration file.

For more information on managing RET, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

Prerequisites

- The Antenna Configuration File is available on a server accessible on the network within the RAN.

Steps

1. Upload the vendor-supplied antenna configuration file to an FTP server with O&amp;M network connectivity to the node. Record the IP address, user ID, password, and file path for the specific user on the FTP server. Note: The documented file path must start from the FTP root directory for the user and start with a slash: / Example The FTP user rbs has the root directory /ftpservice/user/rbs. To place the file example.xml in the subdirectory examples, the file path /ftpservice/user/rbs/examples/example.txt must be used.
2. Execute the RetSubUnit.sendAntennaConfigurationFile MO action. Use the IP address of the FTP server, the file path for the antenna configuration file, and the user ID and password described in Step 1.

Results

The RBS uses the 3GPP Iuant procedure for uploading the file to the RET unit. When

the process finishes, the RBS sends a confirmation to the operator.

```

## 8.2 Configure RET Support for Massive MIMO Radio Unit

MOM allows to create AntennaNearUnit in two different ways. It can

be defined under AntennaUnitGroup or directly under

FieldReplaceableUnit (FRU). Internal RETs are defined

directly under FRU as AntennaUnitGroup is not needed for Massive

MIMO radio unit.

Also RfPort=R is not needed and

AntennaNearUnit.rfPortRef can be left unset.

Prerequisites

- The Antenna Configuration File is available on a server accessible on the network within the RAN.

Steps

1. Upload the SiteEquipment configuration file to an FTP server with O&amp;M network connectivity to the node. Record the IP address, user ID, password, and file path for the specific user on the FTP server. Note: The documented file path must start from the FTP root directory for the user and start with a slash: / Example The FTP user rbs has the root directory /ftpservice/user/rbs.

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement modifies the procedure of scanning a node with device scan

to allow the targeting of specific ports and reduces the duration of the current

procedure to a few seconds or minutes depending on the configuration.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the

EquipmentDiscovery.targetLdn attribute, which allows the

targetability of the device scan. When the targetLdn attribute is

left empty, the AISG device scan procedure scans the whole node according to the

chosen portConfiguration. When the targetLdn

attribute is set to either radio or rfPort LDNs,

then only the selected MOs are scanned. If the targetLdn

attribute contains both radio and rfPort LDNs,

then the performFullAntennaDeviceScan action is rejected with an

inconsistent configuration error. When the

EquipmentDiscovery.antennaDeviceScanInBackground attribute is

set to TRUE the targetLdn attribute is ignored,

and a full scan is executed.

The feature enhancement introduces the following values to the

EquipmentDiscovery.portConfiguration attribute:

- SCAN\_AC\_PORTS\_ONLY
- SCAN\_RF\_PORTS\_ONLY

If a targetLdn contains one or more MOs of

rfPorts, then the portConfiguration

attribute is ignored and only rfPorts specified in the

targetLdn are scanned.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The feature enhancement supports AISG 2.0 and AISG 3.0.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 23.1 or later is required for this feature

enhancement.
