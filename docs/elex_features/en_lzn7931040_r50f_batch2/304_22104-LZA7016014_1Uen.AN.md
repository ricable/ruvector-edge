# 1 Clock Source over NTP Overview

Summary

Clock Source over NTP is a network synchronization method where the RBS locks its clock to

an NTP server that is connected over an IP network.

Clock Source over NTP is one of the methods to lock the clock of the RBS to an external

reference.

The feature requires an NTP server with network synchronization characteristics, for

example, the NTP network synchronization server integrated in the Ericsson RNC. Third-party

options are also available for this purpose.

The clock setting for O&amp;M uses other NTP servers with less strict requirements

regarding frequency stability.

# 2 Dependencies of Clock Source over NTP

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No special hardware for this feature.

Limitations

No limitations for this feature.

Network Requirements

An RBS may be connected to as many as eight NTP servers over an IP network used for

backhaul, as shown in the following figure:

Figure 1   RBS Connectivity to NTP Servers over an IP Network

The NTP servers are defined in the RBS as alternative clock sources in priority

order. Ericsson recommends providing connectivity to two or more NTP servers to

increase network reliability.

The NTP servers used must meet performance characteristics so that RBS can fulfill

performance requirements specified by 3GPP. NTP servers must support 10 NTP requests

per second per client.

An ordinary NTP server based on a commercial computer platform does not provide

required accuracy. Contact Ericsson for advice on NTP servers.

In addition to the performance of the NTP server, the RBS capability to fulfill the

performance requirements of the Uu interface and desired startup time performance

also depends on the Packet Delay Variation (PDV) introduced to the IP packets

carrying NTP request/response messages by the transport network infrastructure.

A transport network infrastructure may provide different delay variation for

different Quality of Service (QoS) classes, so the IP packets carrying the NTP

request/response messages should be marked with the appropriate Differentiated

Services Code Point (DSCP). Configuration of the DSCP value for an IP packet

carrying the NTP request message is described in Parameters.

The DSCP value for an IP packet carrying NTP Response message is defined in the NTP

server.

# 3 Feature Operation

This section describes the details of clock source over NTP, including network configuration

requirements and operation flows. The clock source over NTP feature is an implementation of

the packet based method using SNTP described in ITU-T G.8261.

## 3.1 High Level Flow

The NTP server and RBS generate a series of timestamps, as described

in the following stages:

1. The RBS sends NTP requests periodically to the NTP server. Every NTP request contains the Originate Timestamp that defines the time the NTP request was generated.
2. The NTP server timestamps reception of the NTP request message with the Receive Timestamp, and transmission of the NTP response with the Transmit Timestamp message. The NTP response message contains all three time stamps.
3. The RBS generates a fourth timestamp, Receive Timestamp, when the NTP response message is received. The set of four timestamps are filtered to find suitable multiple sets that the RBS can use to lock its clock using a Differential Time Method algorithm.

A Differential Time Method is based on the time differences between

a master NTP server and slave RBS. The IP packet delays computed from

the time stamps for master and slave allow the RBS to calculate its

oscillator frequency and phase drift compared to the NTP server frequency

and phase, and to tune the RBS clock to the NTP server, as shown in

the following figure:

Figure 2   Clock Reference Generation with Clock Source over NTP

In addition to the timing information described above, the NTP

server can also signal information about the server. The NTP response

messages contain stratum level and leap indicator fields with varying

values. Failure is indicated by the following:

- A stratum level different from one indicates that the NTP server is not controlled by a Primary Reference Clock (PRC) or possibly not synchronized at all
- A leap indication equal to three indicates that the server has a failure condition

An NTP server is considered unreliable if either failure condition

is present.

The RBS sets up NTP processes for clock generation for the Uu interface

towards every preselected NTP server. The frequency of the NTP requests

is 1 to 10 requests per second towards the NTP server as the RBS attempts

to align its clock. The higher request frequency is used at startup

or acquisition to make convergence time shorter and the rate is decreased

when steady state is reached.

The RBS has the NTP process towards preselected alternative NTP

servers to evaluate connectivity and quality to tolerate:

- Loss of connectivity towards the server to which the clock is currently aligned
- Degradation of quality of the server to which the clock is currently aligned

# 4 Parameters

This section describes the parameters used by the Clock Source

over NTP feature.

## 4.1 Introduced Parameters

No parameters are introduced by the implementation of Clock Source

over NTP.

The Managed Object (MO) class

IpSyncRef

administers the NTP

server process, including the domain name and IP address of the NTP

server used as clock source for the Uu interface, as shown in the

following figure:

Figure 3   Configuration of NTP Server Processes

Up to eight instances of

IpSyncRef

can be configured in

an RBS.  The list and priority order of preselected synchronization

references is configured in the

Synchronization

MO.

The DSCP for NTP IP packets carrying NTP Request messages is configured

with

ntpDscp

in the

IpAccessHostEt

MO class.

The

IpAccessHostEt

represents the IP traffic host in the RBS, see the document Transport Network Configuration for a detailed

description.

The detailed list of parameters can be found under the MOs mentioned

above.

## 4.2 Affected Parameters

No parameters are affected significantly by the implementation

of Clock Source over NTP.

# 5 Network Impact

This section describes how the Clock Source over NTP feature impacts

the transport network Infrastructure.

The transport network infrastructure must assure delay variation

performance for a sufficient set of IP packets carrying NTP request/response

messages, so the RBS can lock its clock to the NTP server with required

performance. This may require a QoS-aware transport network infrastructure

that prioritizes the IP packets carrying the NTP Request/Response

messages, see the document Transport Network Configuration for further details.

Clock Source over NTP has no impact on system behavior and performance,

provided that the RBS can lock the clock for the Uu interface to one

of the preselected clock sources.

# 6 Performance

This section describes performance indicators, counters, and events

associated with Clock Source over NTP.

## 6.1 KPIs

No significant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are associated

directly with this feature.

## 6.2 Counters and Events

PM counters for the

Synchronization

MO show the highest delay variation of the best 1%, 10%

and 50% synchronization frames with the lowest delay experienced by

the active NTP server process during the PM interval.

See the document ITU-T Y.1540 for the definition

of Highest Delay Variation.

# 7 O&amp;M Information

Special synchronization requirements exist for IP networks with

high packet delay variation.
