# 1 Fractional Pathloss Power Control Overview

With the feature, it is easier to set power control parameters that enable uplink

peak rate in the cell without sacrificing too much cell-edge performance.

Summary

Trade-off is possible between average and cell edge throughput. For small data

buffers, a lower transmit power at cell-edge can result in lower battery

consumption.

# 3 Feature Operation of Fractional Pathloss Power Control

The feature allows to configure the power control to partially compensate for

pathloss.

The uplink power control for the shared channel is by default configured so that the

target received PSD at the eNodeB is constant, regardless of where in the cell the UE

is. This is done in the UE by estimating pathloss and fully compensating the output

power with that estimation. The target received PSD at the eNodeB is determined by the

attribute pZeroNominalPusch.

Configuring the power control with this feature to compensate for pathloss leads to that

the received PSD depends on the pathloss. This gives a larger freedom in how to optimize

uplink power control. For example, it is possible to lower output power for cell-edge

UEs (high pathloss) to reduce interference spread in the system while still maintaining

a high PSD for cell center users to provide best possible peak bit rates.
