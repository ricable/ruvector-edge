# 2 Dependencies of Port Mirroring

To enable this feature, multiple Ethernet ports are needed.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Port Mirroring

The feature allows traffic in both directions on one Ethernet port to be mirrored to

another Ethernet port.

A protocol analyzer or similar equipment can be connected, and live traffic can be

monitored.

The feature forwards all traffic, except ingress packets that are discarded because of

CRC fault. On the egress side, forwarding is done before applying the Egress IP Traffic

Shaping.

If the capacity of the destination port is exceeded, mirrored packets are dropped.

# 4 Network Impact of Port Mirroring

The feature has no network impact.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

## 4.1 Privacy Implication of Port Mirroring

This feature allows for deep dive troubleshooting and solving protocol problems when

all other means fail.

The feature can be used by both Ericsson and operator trusted personnel. It collects data

containing subscriber personal information, which can be used to identify subscribers

and their behavior in the network. When using this feature, all incoming and outgoing

raw data is captured, what makes it possible to store subscriber data on specific

equipment, such as protocol analyzers.

Access to the feature is restricted, and made available only to trusted personnel because

of its privacy and security sensitiveness. To respect subscriber privacy and to prevent

misuse of port mirroring, the use of the feature is logged, and audit trails are

collected. The information contained in the logs is used if there is a security or

privacy breach, and subsequent investigation.

For more information, see Port

Mirroring.

# 5 Parameters for Port Mirroring

The feature has no configuration parameters.

# 6 Performance of Port Mirroring

The feature does not have associated KPIs, counters, or events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters. The regular Ethernet Port MO counters are

applicable also on the destination port.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Port Mirroring

The feature is activated and controlled by Ericsson CLI commands.

The feature is controlled by the mirror enable and the mirror

disable commands.
