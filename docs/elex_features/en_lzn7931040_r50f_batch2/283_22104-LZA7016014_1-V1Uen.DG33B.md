Summary

The Flexible Counters feature enables the operator to define a counter for any

combination of filter parameters, without the need to define counters for all

combinations. Flexible counters can be differentiated by operator-configurable

filter parameters in runtime.

The main goal of this feature is to provide a new framework for differentiated observability

to be able to produce flexible counters. This is used to get detailed information on

the behavior for a subset of User Equipments (UEs), or to exclude certain UEs from

the legacy observability. A typical use is to calculate KPIs for a subset of UEs, or

to exclude a subset of UEs from the general KPIs.

# 2 Dependencies of Flexible Counters

The feature has dependencies with other features that have an impact on High Power UE

and other features.

# 3 Feature Operation

The feature allows operators to create service specific KPIs without an exponential

growth in number of counters.

## 3.1 Flexible Counters and Sub Flexible Counters

The Flexible Counters feature is introduced to differentiate PM counter by the filter

configuration of the operator. Flexible counters are activated similarly to normal counters by

including each counter in the scanner or job.

Flexible counters have the following characteristics:

- Flexible counters have prefix "pmFlex" to separate them from the normal counters. It provides an easy pattern for OSS or RCS to identify flexible counters. For example, pmFlexPdcpVolDlDrb.
- Base flexible counter names do not appear in ROP files. Instead dynamically created counter names (sub flexible counters) are seen in ROP files.

Sub flexible counters are used for stepping and interpreting flexible counters. Sub flexible

counters are the differentiated form of flexible counters, see Figure 1. Sub flexible counters are dynamically

created in runtime depending on configured filter parameters and also stored in ROP files.

Sub flexible counters have the following characteristics:

- Sub flexible counter name = flexible counter name + "\_"+ filter parameter combination. For example, pmFlexPdcpVolDlDrb\_UeCat1To2Spid2.
- Sub flexible counter names only appear in ROP files and output of pget or show-counters commands.

Figure 1   Flexible Counter and Sub Flexible Counter

Multiple filter combinations can be applied to flexible counters, so flexible counters can

have different meanings and values depending on configured  filter instances.

## 3.2 Filter Parameter Configuration for Flexible Counters

Figure 2   Example of Feature Configuration and Activation

The PmFlexCounterFilter MO is introduced for operators to configure filter

parameter combinations for flexible counters. The following filter parameters are supported,

with up to 48 filter combination instances:

- ARP
- Coverage Enhancement (CE) Level
- EN-DC
- LCG
- PLMN Index
- QCI
- SPID
- UE Category
- UE Power Class
- Subscriber Group
- Pre-emption Capability Indicator
- Pre-emption Vulnerability Indicator (PVI)

See Parameters of Flexible Counters for the detailed attributes.

All configured filter parameters for each MO instance operate with AND

operation. There is a maximum of 48 filter instances.

Configured MO instances are applied to all activated flexible counters and updated MO

instances are applied next ROP start time. Operators can get ROP files that include sub

flexible counters applied to updated MO instances next ROP end time.

To activate flexible counters:

- The filter MO PmFlexCounterFilter is created and configured by operators. Each filter MO instance must be named differently from each other. The Validator prevents the same configuration.Note: The Basic Intelligent Connectivity (FAJ 121 4843) feature is required for the activation of the EN-DC filter parameter.
- A user-defined scanner or job is activated for selected flexible counters. The following PM groups must be included in a Measurement Reader in a PM job to make flexible counters work: PmFlexEUtranCellFDD PmFlexEUtranCellTDD
- The collected values for sub flexible counters are stored into ROP files every 15 minutes.

For instance, three filter MO instances for flexible counters are created or configured as

below. Then pmFlexPdcpVolDlDrb and

pmFlexErabEstabSuccInit are activated through OSS.

![Image](../images/283_22104-LZA7016014_1-V1Uen.DG33B/additional_3_CP.png)

The following six sub flexible counters are created in ROP files and stepped according to the

results of filter matches.

The pget command is used with

the base flexible counter name to display the current value of the sub flexible counters, as

shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3   Pget Command

Parameters of Flexible Counters

## 3.3 Exception Handling for Flexible Counters

Each flexible counter has applicable filters that are described in their MOM description.

The configured filter combinations are applied to all activated flexible counters. If a

configured filter combination is not applicable to an activated flexible counter, the

following happens, depending on the value of the

PmFlexCounterFilter.reportAppCounterOnly MO attribute:

If reportAppCounterOnly = true:

- Non-applicable sub flexible counters does not appear in ROP files, and they are not reported in pget and show-counters.
- PM event INTERNAL\_EVENT\_FLEX\_FILTER\_ISSUE is generated to inform which configured filter parameters are not applicable for the activated flexible counter.

If reportAppCounterOnly = false:

- The values of sub flexible counters are reported to NULL in ROP files.
- The values of sub flexible counters are reported to unsupported (-2) in pget and show-counters.
- PM event INTERNAL\_EVENT\_FLEX\_FILTER\_ISSUE is generated to inform which configured filter parameters are not applicable for the activated flexible counter.

Here is an example of the latter case, if the PmFlexCounterFilter MO

instance is configured as below:

Filter parameters:

reportAppCounterOnly = false

ueCatFilterEnabled = true

ueCatFilterMin = UE\_CATEGORY\_DL\_0\_UL\_0

ueCatFilterMax = UE\_CATEGORY\_DL\_0\_UL\_0

lcgFilterEnabled = TRUE

lcgFilterMin = 0

lcgFilterMax = 0

Activated flexible counters: pmFlexPdcpVolDlDrb,

pmFlexLcgThpVolUl result in the following ROP file look:

: pmFlexPdcpVolDlDrb\_UeCat1Lcg0 = (NULL)

: pmFlexLcgThpVolUl\_UeCat1Lcg0 = 100

Sub flexible counter of pmFlexLcgThpVolUl reports normal value (100), but

LCG is not applicable to pmFlexPdcpVolDlDrb, so sub flexible counter of

pmFlexPdcpVolDlDrb reports NULL.

If no filter MO instance is created or all filter MO instances are configured as

DISABLED when flexible counters are activated, the PM event

INTERNAL\_EVENT\_FLEX\_FILTER\_ISSUE is generated to inform there is no filter configuration. It

is generated once when flexible counters are activated.

Performance of Flexible Counters

# 4 Network Impact of Flexible Counters

The Flexible Counters feature has an impact on MP load and ROP volume during sub

flexible counters generation.

Capacity and Performance

This feature increases MP load and ROP volume when generating sub flexible

counters.

The MP load and ROP volume increase depends on the activated number of filter combinations,

the activated number of flexible counters, and the configured filter combinations. It is

recommended to configure filter combinations to be matched with a smaller subset of UEs or

Bearers (such as the Category M or VoLTE UEs) rather than a larger subset of UEs or Bearers in

the network.

# 6 Performance of Flexible Counters

This section describes performance indicators, counters, and events associated with

the Flexible Counters feature.

KPIs

KPI related flexible counters can compensate legacy KPI counters of legacy KPI

formulas. It means that it provides the opportunity for operators to differentiate

KPI values on configured filter parameters.

The flexible counters to KPI formulas can be applied with either of the following

ways:

- Legacy accessibility success rate for end-user services which is carried by E-RABs included in the E-RAB setup procedure is given by the following equation: This legacy accessibility success rate for added E-RAB establishment can be modified to get success rate only for Category M1 UEs.

![Image](../images/283_22104-LZA7016014_1-V1Uen.DG33B/additional_3_CP.png)
- It can be applied to get success rate excluding Category M1 UEs.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

Filter Parameter Configuration for Flexible Counters

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Flexible Counters

## 8.1 EN-DC Filter Parameter Settings

The value of the PmFlexCounterFilter.endcFilterMin parameter must

be lower than the value of PmFlexCounterFilter.endcFilterMax.

The PmFlexCounterFilter.endcFilterMin and

PmFlexCounterFilter.endcFilterMax parameters both have the type

EndcStage.

Table 3   EN-DC Stage Value Pairs

|   Numerical Value | String Value     |
|-------------------|------------------|
|                 0 | ENDC_NR_CAPABLE  |
|                 1 | ENDC_NR_MATCHED  |
|                 2 | ENDC_NR_ACTIVE   |
|                99 | ENDC_UE_RELEASED |

For more information about the values of the EndcStage enum, see

Managed Object Model (MOM).

If PmFlexCounterFilter.endcFilterMin and

PmFlexCounterFilter.endcFilterMax are both set to 99, the value

of flexible counters filtered with Endc99To99 is always 0.

Therefore, the value of PmFlexCounterFilter.endcFilterMin must be

lower than the value of PmFlexCounterFilter.endcFilterMax.

The different EN-DC stages are reflected in the stepping of different flexible

counters.

Figure 4   EN-DC Stage Adaptation

- The EN-DC stage moves to stage 0 when EN-DC is not capable or matched. For example, when the B1 measurement is not possible because the LTE cell configuration does not support EN-DC setup.
- The EN-DC stage remains at stage 1 as long as the UE remains in a cell where EN-DC is capable and matched before split bearer setup. For example, as long as the UE NR capability matches the current LTE cell configuration for split bearer setup.
- The EN-DC stage moves to stage 2 when the SCG radio resources are set up.
- The EN-DC stage changes from stage 2 to stage 1 on the following conditions: The SCG radio resources are released. EN-DC is capable and matched. The DRB is still SN-terminated.

This feature provides seven new flexible counters that can be used to evaluate the KPIs of

customers. Pm events associated with new flexible counters are updated to have all

applicable filter parameters for providing improved CTR or UETR. This also makes it

possible to create flexible counters in other network elements, for example in OSS or

the post-processing tools of customers.

The EN-DC change conditions are simpler and more consistent.

Capacity and Performance

The flexible counters for EN-DC stage 1 are stepped more often because of the

adjusted conditions for EN-DC stage change. In accordance with this, the flexible

counters for EN-DC stage 0 are stepped less often.

Operation

All flexible counters that use the PmFlexCounterFilter.EndcStage

filter parameter are affected by this enhancement.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
