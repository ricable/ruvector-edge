# 2 Dependencies of PDCCH Coverage Extension

The PDCCH Coverage Extension feature is part of the LTE Base Package.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

Affected System Functions

If the Enhanced PDCCH Link Adaptation feature is activated, a

small degradation in retainability can be observed as a trade off for the capacity

gain. In case of carrier aggregation, a small user throughput degradation can be

noticed because of less accurate target Block Error Rate (BLER) control.

# 3 Feature Operation of PDCCH Coverage Extension

The feature improves the PDCCH performance and the coverage area during

interference.

In dense radio networks interference is always presented. In some cases, it affects the

PDCCH performance severely, which reduces the coverage area. In these scenarios the DCI

format used in downlink, with a larger data size than that used for uplink grants, makes

downlink limit at the coverage area.

The PDCCH Coverage Extension feature addresses this by forcing the use of DCI format 1A

for downlink assignments on the PDCCH in the following cases:

- The estimated downlink SINR is poor
- The corresponding data on PDSCH is prioritized

As it has a smaller size, the coding rate decreases and the coverage improves.

Using DCI format 1A for downlink has limitations, in comparison with the most often used

DCI 2/2A formats. DCI 1A  only supports one codeword and consecutive resource allocation

of PRBs.

The feature is divided into three options, which are individually enabled by the

operator. The options correspond to which type of data that is viewed as prioritized.

The options are as follows:

- SRB
- Voice bearer
- The first retransmission on the voice bearer or SRB following after a DTX verdict

# 4 Network Impact of PDCCH Coverage Extension

The impact on the network and capacity depends on which functions are enabled for the

feature.

Capacity and Performance

The network capacity can be decreased, because of the CCE aggregation level increase

which increases the risk of congestion on the PDCCH. The more options that are

enabled the higher the impact is.

The downlink throughput can be decreased because of the limitations of DCI 1A format

regarding one codeword and consecutive resource allocation. The more options that

are enabled the higher the impact is.

The RRC procedure success rate is expected to improve, because of the more robust

PDCCH operation, when the SRB and DTX options are enabled.

The voice quality in the downlink direction is expected to improve, because of the

more robust PDCCH operation which reduces delays and packet loss, when any of the

following options are enabled:

- QCI 1
- DTX

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for PDCCH Coverage Extension

The feature has three configuration parameters depending on the function it is enabled

for.

Events

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines of PDCCH Coverage Extension

The PDCCH Coverage Extension feature is enabled by setting the MOM parameters to

true for the desired functionality.

Table 3    Parameters Introduced by PDCCH Coverage Extension

| Parameter           | Value   | Description                                           |
|---------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| pdcchCovImproveSrb  | True    | The feature is enabled for SRB.                       |
| pdcchCovImproveQci1 | True    | The feature is enabled for QCI 1.                     |
| pdcchCovImproveDtx  | True    | The feature is enabled for retransmissions after DTX. |

SINR Target Modification

The SINR estimation is based on the CQI report. For a detailed description, see Power Control. This feature adds an offset to this estimate to

make the link adaptation more robust. This can increase the CCE aggregation level or, if the

PDCCH Power Boost feature is used, a power boost of the associated CCEs for the SRB

option.

DCI Format 1A Qualification

There are some preconditions to use DCI format 1A for downlink assignments.

For new transmissions, DCI format 2/2A is chosen.

For retransmissions, the initial transmission used one of the DCI formats 1A, 2 or 2A, and

only used one codeword.

DTX Qualification

To qualify a transmission as the first transmission following after a DTX occurred, the

HARQ processes are checked at the transmission time.

## 8.1 SRB Signaling

To use DCI format 1A for the SRB signaling data option at operation, do the

following:

Figure 1   DCI Format 1A for SRB Signaling

Steps

1. Enable the downlink assignment for SRB data and the PDCCH Coverage Extension option for SRB, or go to Step 6.
2. Check if the transmission qualifies for using DCI format 1A, or go to Step step 6.
3. Perform SINR target modification.
4. Check if the resulting CCE aggregation level is equal to MAX or continue with Step 6.
5. Use DCI format 1A for the downlink assignment.
6. Procedure done.

## 8.2 QCI 1 - Voice Data

To use DCI format 1A for the QCI 1 voice data option at operation, do the following:

Figure 2   DCI format 1A for QCI 1

Steps

1. Enable the downlink assignment is for QCI 1 data and the PDCCH Coverage Extension option for QCI 1, or go to Step 5.
2. Check if the transmission qualifies for using DCI format 1A, or go to Step 5.
3. Check if the resulting CCE aggregation level is equal to MAX, or go to Step 5.
4. Use DCI format 1A for the downlink assignment.
5. Procedure done.

## 8.3 DTX

To use DCI format 1A for the first retransmission of data following after a DTX verdict at

operation, do the following:

Figure 3   DCI Format 1A for Retransmission After DTX

Steps

1. Enable the downlink assignment is DTX qualified, or go to Step 5.
2. Check if the downlink assignment is for SRB or QCI 1 data, or go to Step 5. Note: Only works for the SRB if the SRB option is disabled, otherwise the SRB option takes precedence.
3. Check if the transmission qualifies for using DCI format 1A, or go to Step 5.
4. Use DCI format 1A for the downlink assignment.
5. Procedure done.
