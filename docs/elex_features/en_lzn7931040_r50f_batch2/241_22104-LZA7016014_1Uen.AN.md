Benefits

Cross-connecting the antenna feeders between the radios and the antennas prevent a single

point of failure, for example, a faulty radio, from causing the entire sector to be

lost. During a hardware fault the eNodeB runs in degraded mode, with one TX/RX

branch. This makes it possible to plan and schedule a site visit in a suitable time

of the particular site.

# 2 Dependencies of Cross-Sector Antenna Sharing Redundancy

The feature has dependencies with other features related to coverage and

capacity.

Hardware

No special hardware requirement.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The following must be fulfilled to use this feature:

- This antenna feeder cross-connection is only useful if dual TX-capable radios are being used.
- All sectors included in the antenna feeder cross-connection must have the same output power.
- All cells must have the same bandwidth.

# 3 Feature Operation of Cross-Sector Antenna Sharing Redundancy

The feature introduces redundancy in configurations with TX-capable radios in a

multi-sector site.

The redundancy introduced by the feature is achieved by cross-connecting the antenna feeders

between the radios and the antennas. This way one antenna unit is served by two radios and one

radio serves two antenna units.

This principle is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1   The Principle of Cross-Sector Antenna Sharing Redundancy

This configuration allows for performance security in case of radio faults. Every faulty

radio affects two sectors. The fault causes both sectors to lose one antenna feeder each.

Losing these connections causes degraded performance in the radio, but ensures coverage in

both sectors.

The node is out of operation during the identification of the fault and the re-configuration

of the impacted sectors and cells. For more information, see Manage

Faults.

Example 1   Basic Configuration

Figure 2 shows an example of the connections

between the hardware and the MO structure for a basic three-sector configuration with the

Cross-Sector Antenna Sharing Redundancy feature.

Figure 2   Three-Sector Configuration with Cross-Sector Antenna Sharing Redundancy

## 3.1 Feature Implementations

### 3.1.1 Implementation with TMA, FDD Only

The feature can be used with TMAs in two alternative ways, as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3   Alternative Feature Implementations with TMA

The two implementation alternatives can behave differently depending on whether the fault

appears in the radio or in the TMA.

The impacts of the two different fault scenarios are described in Table 2, where alternative 2 is the recommended way of

implementation.

Table 2   Fault Impacts Depending of Configuration Alternative

| Fault Scenario                                                              | Impact of Configuration Alternative 1                                                                                       | Impact of Configuration Alternative 2                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Radio 1 failure     Breakdown of RF(1)      DC and signaling to TMA is lost | One TX/RX branch is lost in both Sector 1 and Sector 2.     TMA functionality is lost for the remaining branch in Sector 1. | One TX/RX branch is lost in both Sector 1 and Sector 2.    |
| TMA 1 failure                                                               | Sector 1 is lost.(2)                                                                                                        | One TX/RX branch is lost in both Sector 1 and Sector 2.(3) |

(1)  Radio Frequency(2)  If the TMA has support of bypass

mode the impact will be reduced sensitivity for Sector 1.(3)  If the TMA has support of bypass mode the impact will be reduced

sensitivity for Sector 1 and Sector 2.

Example 2   Two-Sector Configuration

Figure 4 and Figure 5 show examples of the connections between

the hardware and the MO structure for two-sector configurations.

### 3.1.3 Implementation with Mixed Mode, FDD Only

The feature is supported for mixed mode configuration for WCDMA and LTE.

In mixed mode, two or more DUs or Baseband units of different radio standards share a radio

unit.

If the LTE node is configured to control RETs and TMAs, all antenna configurations using

RETs, TMAs, or both, which are supported by LTE, can be used for the feature for mixed mode

configuration.

If Cross-Sector Antenna Sharing Redundancy for mixed mode WCDMA and LTE is used with ARET

through the RET port in the antenna system the WCDMA node or the LTE node can control the

antenna system.

For more information about mixed mode and how to manage the antenna system in mixed mode, see

Mixed Mode All-In-One User

Guide.

Process Steps

The feature must be configured on both the WCDMA and the LTE node in the following way:

- All external radios and all sectors within the same cluster must use the same bandwidth.Note: The same bandwidths are supported for the feature that can be used for the WCDMA and LTE mixed mode configuration.

An example of how to configure the feature for WCDMA and LTE mixed mode is shown in Figure 11.

Figure 11   Cross-Sector Antenna Sharing Redundancy Configuration in Mixed Mode

The feature can be used in mixed mode configurations with three sectors, as shown in Figure 12.

ways, as shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14.

Alternative One

Figure 14   Cross-Sector Antenna Sharing Redundancy Configuration in Mixed Mode with Six Sectors,

shown in Figure 15 for an example.

Mode

### 3.1.4 Non-supported Implementation, FDD Only

The combination of a TMA and a RET directly connected to the radio RET Port must be avoided

to ensure a stable configuration. This configuration is shown in Figure 17.

|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Availability | During a hardware fault, the redundancy provided by the feature                                     increases cell availability.                                                                                                                                                                               |

The other sector will have decreased                                     throughput. |

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no directly associated performance events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
