Summary

Features that require

frequency synchronization can benefit from this feature. The Clock Source over

SASE

feature enables the frequency synchronization of the node through the

synchronization front port (marked GPS or SYNC). 2MHz or 10 MHz and 1 PPS signals can be

used as frequency synchronization reference.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

The synchronization network has to be designed so that during a fault free situation

there is a connection to a PRC source. For more information, see Network Synchronization.

# 3 Feature Operation of Clock Source over SASE

The Clock Source over SASE feature is one of the methods to lock the clock of the RBS

to an external

reference..

The feature uses attributes in the Synchronization MO to administer clock

source for the Uu interface.

The TuSyncRef MO class, a child of MO class TimingUnit,

administers clock source for the Uu interface directly connected to the Digital Unit (DU), as

shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1   Configuration of SASE as Clock Source

The list and priority order of preselected synchronization references is configured in the

Synchronization MO. For the detailed list of parameters, see Managed Object Model (MOM).

# 4 Network Impact of Clock Source over SASE

The feature has an impact on network functions and capabilities.

Capacity and Performance

If all connected synchronization references of the node fail, the node goes into frequency

holdover mode to keep the specified frequency. The duration of frequency holdover mode

ranges from a day to several weeks. An alarm is sent when the holdover duration is about to

end.

If none of the synchronization references are regained before the holdover duration ends,

the RBS shuts down the cells.

The number of front ports where the signal is connected is limited to one port per Baseband

Unit.

Interfaces

Using the Clock Source SASE feature is one method to meet the requirement for

frequency synchronization of the Uu interface. For a general overview of these methods, see

Network Synchronization.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Clock Source over SASE

The feature does not introduce or affect any already existing parameters.

# 6 Performance of Clock Source over SASE

The feature has no associated KPIs, counters, or events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
