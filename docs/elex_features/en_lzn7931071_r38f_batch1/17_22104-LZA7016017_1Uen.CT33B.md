Hardware

The feature is enabled on all radio units which support High-Band.

Limitations

The following feature limitations apply to the feature:

- In one PAAM segment, the same cell is selected as the PSCell for all devices.
- A maximum of four NR component carriers can be aggregated.
- The component carriers must have the same numerology, with 120 kHz subcarrier spacing.
- The component carriers must operate on the same Baseband unit.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation High-Band

The feature enables higher throughput to dual connectivity-capable devices by

aggregating up to four NR carriers.

Operational Process

The feature is configured during the initial setup of SCG

radio resources.

All UEs within the same coverage area use the same cell as

PSCell. The cell with the lowest NR-ARFCN that is also uplink-capable is selected as the

PSCell. If the Multiple PSCells High-Band feature is used, each sector is

configured with two PSCells.

Contiguous and non-contiguous bands are supported.

Link adaptation is performed on each carrier. The Scheduler High-Band feature utilizes all

component carriers to maximize throughput in each downlink slot.

The number of aggregated carriers depends on the UE

capability and on the number of Secondary Node-configured cells.

Figure 1   NR 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation

It is possible to use mixed bandwidths in a carrier aggregation configuration. 50 MHz

and 100 MHz bandwidths are supported.

SCG Configuration Selection in the Secondary Node

The Secondary Node selects an SCG configuration, supported both by the UE and the NR

cells, that maximizes the aggregated bandwidth.

## 3.1 Intra-Band Carrier Aggregation

The feature supports the aggregation of carriers on the same frequency

band.

Contiguous Intra-Band Carrier Aggregation

In case of contiguous intra-band carrier aggregation, the carriers are located next

to one another within the same band. The carriers are allocated with a defined

nominal channel spacing, which is between their center frequencies.

Channel spacing can be equal to or less than the nominal value. In such cases, the

Secondary Node considers carriers for contiguous intra-band carrier aggregation.

Figure 2   Contiguous Intra-Band Carrier Aggregation

Non-Contiguous Intra-Band Carrier Aggregation

In case of non-contiguous carrier aggregation, the carriers are located within the

same band, with a spectrum of uncoordinated operation between them. This spectrum

may be owned by another operator. The intra-band gap must be a multiple of 50

MHz.

If the channel spacing is larger than the nominal value, the Secondary Node considers

the carriers for non-contiguous carrier aggregation.

Figure 3   Non-Contiguous Intra-Band Carrier Aggregation

For more information on nominal channel spacing, see 3GPP TS 38.101-2; NR; User

Equipment (UE) Radio Transmission and Reception; Part 2: Range 2

Standalone.

## 3.2 SCell Configuration and Link Scheduling

SCell Configuration

SCells are configured with blind selection. All configured cells in the Secondary

Node that are not PSCells can be SCell candidates.

An SCell configured for both uplink and downlink traffic is a candidate for uplink

aggregation. A maximum of three SCells can be configured for

uplink and downlink traffic for each sector.

Once an SCell is configured for a UE, the configuration remains until the SCG radio

resources are released.

SCell Activation

Initially only the PSCell is activated. SCells are activated based on the uplink or

downlink throughput need. The uplink or downlink throughput need activates all

SCells to provide throughput according to the following requirements:

- The downlink need is activated if enough data remains in the buffer after a successful PSCell scheduling.
- The uplink need is activated based on the uplink buffer estimate and the UE power headroom.

The number of scheduled SCells determines UE power for each SCell

and the resulting SINR. Therefore, uplink link adaptation needs to consider the

number of scheduled SCells. For more information about

secondary cell activation, see Dynamic Component Carrier Management.

All active SCells are deactivated if the UE reports UAI overheating.

SCell reactivation is not allowed until the overheating condition is mitigated. If

the UAI overheating is mitigated, SCells can be reactivated if the PSCell capacity

is not sufficient to serve the needed downlink or uplink data.

Link Scheduling

Downlink scheduling is performed on all activated PSCell and SCells if the following

requirements are met:

- The reported CQI of these cells is larger than 0.
- There is downlink data in the buffer to transmit.

Uplink scheduling is always performed on the PSCell. If the radio quality and the UE

power headroom for the PSCell are sufficient, uplink scheduling is also performed on

the SCell.

When multiple PSCells are used, not all configured SCells are scheduled for a UE in a

given Transmission Time Interval (TTI) if the following characteristics apply:

- One UE from each PSCell is scheduled in a TTI.
- SCells are shared between UEs.

New data and retransmissions can be sent in parallel, within the same slot, on

different carriers.

If the Dynamic Component Carrier Management feature is not activated, the SCells

remain activated until the SCG radio resources are released.

# 4 Network Impact of NR 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation High-Band

The feature improves downlink throughput with the aggregation of up to four carriers.

Capacity and Performance

In dual connectivity-capable devices, the maximum UE downlink throughput increases

with the number of aggregated carriers. The cell capacity is expected to increase

because of faster and more efficient data transmission.

Devices, which do not support dual connectivity, behave according to the legacy LTE

capacity.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

The UE must support downlink carrier aggregation as specified in the following

documentation:

- 3GPP TS 38.101-4; NR; User Equipment (UE) Radio Transmission and Reception; Part 4: Performance Requirements

# 5 Parameters for NR 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation High-Band

The feature does not introduce or affect any parameters.

# 6 Performance of NR 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation High-Band

The feature impacts volume and time counters.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines of NR 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation High-Band

## 8.1 Configure Transmission Direction and SCell Relation in High-Band

The NRCellRelation and the NRSectorCarrier MO

instances have configurable attributes in high-band that define the following cell

properties:

- SCell relation
- Direction of the transmission

The NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute is used to define a

cell to be referenced as an SCell.

The NRCellRelation.coverageIndicator is used to define the

coverage area relation of all cells in one sector.

The NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute must be set to

ALLOWED or ONLY\_ALLOWED\_FOR\_DL for all cells

that are SCell candidates. The NRCellRelation.coverageIndicator

attribute must be set to OVERLAP for each cell in the same

sector.

The NRSectorCarrier.txDirection attribute is used to define the

direction of the

transmission.

Among the cells configured for uplink and downlink traffic, the cell with the lowest

ARFCN is selected as PSCell. If the Multiple PSCells High-Band feature is enabled, also the

cell configured for uplink and downlink traffic with highest ARFCN is selected as

PSCell if they are assigned to different PAAM segments. One SCell

adjacent to the PSCell can be configured for both uplink and downlink traffic which

allows uplink carrier aggregation. The other uplink- and downlink-configured cells

are used for uplink and downlink carrier aggregation. The other SCell or SCells

within the same sector must be configured to have downlink capability only.

- The SectorEquipmentFunction MO is configured and available to be associated with the NRSectorCarrier MO.
- The following attributes of the NRSectorCarrier MO are configured with valid values: NRSectorCarrier.arfcnDL NRSectorCarrier.arfcnUL NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwDL NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwUL NRSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower

Steps

1. Set the NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
2. Configure the NRSectorCarrier.txDirection attribute to set the transmission direction of a sector carrier.
    1. Set the NRSectorCarrier.txDirection attribute value on the PSCell candidate sector carriers to DL\_AND\_UL. The PSCell candidate with the lowest ARFCN is selected as PSCell. If the Multiple PSCells High-Band feature is enabled, the PSCell candidates with the lowest and highest ARFCN are selected as PSCells if they are assigned to different PAAM segments. The other PSCell candidate sector carriers can be used as SCells for uplink and downlink carrier aggregation.
    2. Set the NRSectorCarrier.txDirection attribute value on the remaining SCell candidate sector carriers to DL. These sector carriers can be used as SCells for downlink carrier aggregation.
3. Verify that the NRCellRelation MO is set up according to the following steps:
    1. Set the NRCellRelation.sCellCandidate attribute value to ALLOWED or ONLY\_ALLOWED\_FOR\_DL for SCell candidate sector carriers in a sector. This configuration allows cells in a sector to be SCell candidates.
    2. Set the NRCellRelation.coverageIndicator attribute value to OVERLAP to define cell relations in a given coverage area.
4. Set the NRSectorCarrier.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

Results

The cell relation for SCells and the transmission direction for a sector carrier is

configured.

The SCell configured for uplink and downlink traffic allows uplink carrier

aggregation. Other cells with downlink capability only can be selected as the SCells

for downlink carrier aggregation.

Setting new values in the following attribute combinations can interrupt traffic on

all cells using the AIR unit:

- NRSectorCarrier.arfcnDL and NRSectorCarrier.arfcnUL
- NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwDLand NRSectorCarrier.bSChannelBwUL

## 8.2 Configure Antenna Segmentation

This procedure is applicable to Indoor AIR 1279, AIR 1281, AIR 5322, and Streetmacro

6705 units.

Steps

- Configure the preferred antenna segmentation by following the instructions described in the Manage Hardware Equipment document.

## 8.3 Asymmetric Power Configuration in NR High-Band

Asymmetric carrier allocation occurs on radios with multiple PAAM segments in which the

carriers cannot be evenly distributed, for example when the frequency separation of the

carriers is larger than the bandwidth of a PAAM segment.

The asymmetric setting of NRSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower

attribute among carriers is allowed.

The PSCell must be mapped to the carrier with the highest output power:

- The PSCell handles all necessary control procedures and defines the coverage for the UE.
- The PSCell is currently assigned to the NRSectorCarrier MO instance with the lowest or highest ARFCN that has the NRSectorCarrier.txDirection attribute set to DL\_AND\_UL.

SCells can be assigned to carriers with lower output power. The recommended maximum power

difference between the PSCell and any SCell is 6-8 dB.

PSCell and SCells can be in the same or in different PAAM segments.

Instead of the immediate activation of all SCells, only the PSCell is active at first.

The SCells are activated only if the PSCell cannot deliver the needed throughput.

Capacity and Performance

UE power consumption is optimized based on the amount of downlink data that is needed

to be transferred.

Operation

The activation and deactivation of the SCells depend on the amount of data in the

downlink buffer.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

No impact.
