Summary

This feature decreases heat generation by limiting the downlink traffic when the

radio unit approaches the temperature limit. This extends the ambient temperature

range in which the radio unit can operate and minimizes the probability of total

loss of downlink service due to overheating.

Hardware

This feature is supported on the following radio units:

- Mid-Band radio units
- The following Low-Band Remote radio units with external antenna: Radio 2271 Radio 4471HP Radio 4485 44B7 44B25 44B66A C Radio 4490 Radio 4490HP Radio 4890HP

Limitations

The performance of this feature is reduced when the feature is used in a mixed mode

configuration with any of the following RATs:

- GSM
- WCDMA
- NB-IoT in standalone deployment mode

This feature must not be used simultaneously with radio power sharing.

If this feature is active, radio power sharing must be disabled manually on radio units

with radio power sharing. For information on how to disable radio power sharing, see

Manage Radio Network. For more information about radio power

sharing, see Manage Hardware Equipment.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of NR Intelligent Temperature Handling

This feature decreases heat generation by limiting and reshaping served traffic when

the radio approaches the temperature or the load

limit.

High ambient temperature with high traffic load lead to high internal temperature in the

radio unit. When a radio unit detects that the internal temperature exceeds a threshold,

the radio unit sends signals of overheating to the Baseband unit. The Baseband unit

activates this feature to minimize the probability of total loss of downlink service by

limiting and reshaping the downlink traffic served on the overheating radio unit.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Intelligent Temperature Handling

This feature might reduce cell throughput and increase traffic delays when the radio

approaches the temperature

limit.

Capacity and Performance

This feature introduces the following impacts on served downlink traffic due to

overheating:

- Decreased cell throughput
- Increased delays

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for NR Intelligent Temperature Handling

The feature does not introduce or affect, and is not affected by any

parameters.

# 6 Performance of NR Intelligent Temperature Handling

The feature uses existing counters to monitor PDSCH

scheduling.

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

The following PM counters are used to monitor PDSCH scheduling:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioPdschEmptySlots
- NRCellDU.pmRadioPdschEmptySlotsForced

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
