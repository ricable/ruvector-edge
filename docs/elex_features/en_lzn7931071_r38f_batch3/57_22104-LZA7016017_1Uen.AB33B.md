Summary

The feature makes it possible to customize common channel beamforming in NR with

external antennas connected to TDD Remote radio units. The customization of common

channel beamforming allows flexible coverage in different environments. In addition,

the feature provides a means to customize beamforming weights for the common

channels in downlink.

By using the feature, an Ericsson proprietary, predefined coverage shape can also be

employed. With this proprietary implementation, the coverage shape can be maintained

with full transmission power.

The feature is operable on all NR sector carriers that use a Remote radio unit.

# 2 Dependencies of Common Channel Beamforming on Remote Radio Units

The feature has certain limitations regarding radio units.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

The feature provides the benefits in common channel beamforming for 8TX/8RX TDD

Remote radio units used in NR. For the list of such radio units, see Radio Node Configurations.

The Ericsson proprietary, predefined coverage shape assumes the use of external

antennas with two polarizations and four columns in one row.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Common Channel Beamforming on Remote Radio Units

The feature allows the use of common channel beamforming and custom beamforming

weights on TDD Remote radio units in NR.

Beamforming is a signal processing technique that is used in antenna arrays to transmit

signals. Common channel beamforming can be used to transmit cell-specific and

UE-specific downlink information. Therefore, wide beam design techniques are

incorporated in beamforming weight calculations. Beamforming weights are applied to

control the direction of the wavefront of the different signals. The amplitude and the

phase of the signals of each antenna in an array need appropriate beamforming weights.

Common beamforming weights are used in downlink to transmit the following signals and

channels:

- SSB (PSS, SSS, and PBCH)
- PDCCH
- PDSCH, before PMI is available
- Associated DMRS
- TRS

With the Common Channel Beamforming on Remote Radio Units feature, Ericsson-designed,

proprietary common beam weights are applied to antennas with either 65° or 90°

horizontal HPBW for each column. The Ericsson-designed beam results in a 65° coverage

shape. If the antennas have different horizontal HPBW properties, custom beamforming

weights need to be configured.

The AntennaSubunit.azimuthHalfPowerBeamwidth attribute must be

configured with the same value as the azimuth HPBW of each column of the external

antennas. The provided common beamforming weights are based on the configured value of

this attribute.

Lambda represents the wavelength.

The AntennaSubunit.commonChBeamfrmPortMap attribute is used to select

the pattern of beamforming antenna port mapping. For the Common Channel Beamforming on

Remote Radio Units feature, the attribute must be set to the value

CROSS\_POLARIZED in NR.

Beamforming weights for common channels can be customized in downlink manually.

Operator-designed coverage shape and custom beamforming weights can be set by using the

following attributes:

- AntennaSubunit.customComChBeamfrmWtsAmplitude
- AntennaSubunit.customComChBeamfrmWtsPhase

Figure 1   Examples of Ericsson-Designed and Operator-Designed Coverage and Beamforming

Weights

The values set for the attributes that customize beamforming weights are indexed to match

the indexing of the parameters set in the

SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attribute for a given sector.

This is needed for the correct mapping of the common channel data to the antenna

branches.

The downlink antenna calibration function is enabled by default. It can be enabled

through the NRSectorCarrier.dlCalibrationEnabled attribute. It is

recommended to disable the downlink antenna calibration function in 8TX/8RX TDD radio

units in configurations that do not support antenna calibration to avoid

Antenna DL Calibration Failure and

Service Degraded alarms.

All the attributes set in the AntennaSubunit MO take effect at

unlocking the SectorEquipmentFunction MO that represents a given

sector for which custom beamforming weights are configured. The feature is operable on

all NRSectorCarrier MO instances that reference the

SectorEquipmentFunction MO instance.

# 4 Network Impact of Common Channel Beamforming on Remote Radio Units

# 6 Performance of Common Channel Beamforming on Remote Radio Units

This feature does not have associated KPIs, counters, or

events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Common Channel Beamforming on Remote Radio Units

## 8.1 Configuration for 8TX/8RX Radios in Combination with Eight-Port Antenna Units

To ensure that the antennas are correctly connected to the antenna ports and have a

stable polarization pattern for common channel beamforming, the following connections

must be aligned with each other:

- The physical cabling, that connects the following ports: The external antenna ports on the antenna unit. These ports are defined in the corresponding AuPort MO instances. The antenna feeder ports on the radio. These ports are defined in the corresponding RfPort MO instances.
- The physical and virtual connection between the cell and the RBS equipment

The order of the RfBranch MO references under the

SectorEquipmentFunction MO must be configured to ensure that the

connection between the RAN Compute unit ports and the antenna external ports is aligned

with the chosen physical cabling pattern. This can be configured through the

corresponding RfBranch.rfPortRef and

SectorEquipmentFunction.rfBranchRef attributes.

The physical cabling patterns can be, for example, one of the following ABBs:

- ABB8\_1A Figure 2 ABB8\_1A Cabling Pattern
- ABB8\_1B Figure 3 ABB8\_1B Cabling Pattern
- ABB8\_2A Figure 4 ABB8\_2A Cabling Pattern
- ABB8\_2B Figure 5 ABB8\_2B Cabling Pattern

These ABBs support both 8TX/8RX and 2 × 4TX/4RX operations. The 2 × 4TX/4RX

operation is supported because of increased virtual IBW.

Regardless of the chosen cabling, the first four RfBranch MO

references must correspond to the AuPort MOs with one polarization in

a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit. The last four

RfBranch MO references must correspond to the

AuPort MOs with the other polarization, also in a left-to-right

order.

The physical cabling for connecting the 8TX/8RX radios with eight-port antenna units must

be aligned with the MO configurations to have the proper antenna polarization

pattern.

For ABB8\_1A and ABB8\_2A cabling pattern, the following rules apply:

- RfPort=A, RfPort=B, RfPort=E, and RfPort=F, in that order, must be connected to one polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.
- RfPort=C, RfPort=D, RfPort=G, and RfPort=H, in that order, must be connected to one polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.

For ABB8\_1B and ABB8\_2B cabling pattern, the following rules apply:

- RfPort=A to RfPort=D, in that order, must be connected to one polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.
- RfPort=E to RfPort=H, in that order, must be connected to the other polarization in a left-to-right order, facing the front of the antenna unit.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 21.Q3: Downlink Antenna Calibration for 8TX/8RX TDD Radios in NR

The downlink antenna calibration function is introduced for non-AAS-capable 8TX/8RX

TDD radios used in NR. The function calibrates the hardware phase shift between different

antenna branches to ensure reliable performance of smart antenna functions and

features.

|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5179                                   |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package                                |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002                                   |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                            |
| Access Type:            | NR                                             |

Benefits

With downlink antenna calibration used on 8TX/8RX TDD radios in NR, the following

benefits can be realized:

- Enabling common channels to be transmitted on all antenna branches.
- Custom common channel beamforming weights can be configured for 8TX/8RX TDD radios used in NR and mixed mode.

Capacity and Performance

Depending on the following network conditions, downlink MAC throughput is

increased:

- Deployment
- Site conditions
- Area

Operation

Downlink antenna calibration, applied to 8TX/8RX radios in NR, supports the following

cases:

- All supported bandwidths configurable for PDCCH and PDSCH
- Downlink data transfer up to four layers
- HARQ and link adaptation

The antenna calibration status is shown in the

dlCalibrationStatus member of the

NRSectorCarrier.dlCalibrationData attribute. If the

dlCalibrationStatus displays FAILED, the

Antenna Calibration DL Failure alarm is raised on

the NRSectorCarrier MO.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

Downlink antenna calibration is only applicable to 8TX/8RX TDD radios among the

non-AAS-capable radios used in NR.

Other Network Elements

ENM version 21.2 or later is recommended for this system

improvement.

| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package                                |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002                                   |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                            |
| Access Type:            | NR                                             |

Summary and Benefits

Increased robustness is ensured in downlink antenna calibration fault handling.

When downlink antenna calibration is used for 8TX/8RX radios in an LTE + NR mixed mode

configuration, TDD switch point misalignment is possible. When the system detects

TDD switch point misalignment, the following fault indication is used:

- The dlCalibrationStatus member of the NRSectorCarrier.dlCalibrationData attribute displays FAILED.
- The Antenna Calibration DL Failure alarm is raised on the NRSectorCarrier MO.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

Downlink antenna calibration fault handling is only applicable to 8TX/8RX TDD radios

among the non-AAS-capable radios used in NR.

When downlink antenna calibration is used, TDD switch point misalignment can be

expected with the following radios in an LTE + NR mixed mode configuration:

- Radio 8823
- Radio 8836
