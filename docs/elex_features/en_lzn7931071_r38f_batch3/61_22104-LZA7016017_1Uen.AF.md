Summary

The NR Public Warning System feature supports the ETWS and the CMAS cell broadcast

functions. The CMAS is also known as WEA.

The feature provides support for all Shared Network Operators to use the PWS with all

MOCN configurations.

Figure 1   NR Public Warning System Architecture

As shown in Figure 1, the gNodeB receives the

notifications on the NG-C interface from the AMF in the NGAP WRITE-REPLACE

WARNING REQUEST message. The following information is indicated in the

message:

- Source and notification type
- Repetition period
- Number of repetitions
- Geofencing information (optional)

The repetition period is indicated by the Repetition Period IE. All

repetition periods are supported by the feature. All messages can have different

repetition periods.

The number of repetitions is indicated by the Number of Broadcasts

Requested IE. The total broadcast time is the product of the

Repetition Period and the Number of Broadcasts

Requested IEs.

The notifications are broadcast in the cells and indicated in the Warning Area

List IE. Or, if this IE is not included, the notifications are handled

by the gNodeB in all cells.

Geofencing information is sent from the AMF to the gNodeB over the NG-C interface in

the NGAP WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message.

The NGAP WRITE-REPLACE WARNING RESPONSE message indicates to the AMF

whether the gNodeB is able to perform the requested broadcast in all requested

cells, or in which cells.

Earthquake and Tsunami Warning System

ETWS has the following types of warning notifications:

| Primary   |    | The primary notification contains the type of the disaster and can be one 							of the following:  Earthquake only     Tsunami only     Both earthquake and tsunami     Test     Other     The primary notification is broadcast in SIB6 in one segment and 							must be broadcast within 4 s after reaching the border of the operator 							network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Secondary |    | The secondary notification contains information relevant to the disaster. 							These can contain, for example, information of blocked roads and where 							to seek help. Only one secondary notification is broadcast at a time, 							and it is repeated several times within a specified period as requested 							by CBC or Cell Broadcast Center Function (CBCF). The secondary 							notification is broadcast in SIB7. To cope with large information 							contents, the secondary notification can be segmented and sent in a 							sequence of up to 64 instances of a SIB7. Numbering the segments allows 							the UE to recompile the original message from the received segments. |

The ETWS part of the PWS enables operators to comply with the legal requirement to

support ETWS. Users with ETWS-capable UEs get early warning of a disaster and

additional instructions based on their specific location.

Commercial Mobile Alert System

The CMAS alerts are broadcast in SIB8. In contrast to ETWS notification, concurrent

CMAS alerts can be broadcast simultaneously. A CMAS message can be segmented into 64

occurrences of SIB8 instances. The notifications are repeated a number of times

within a specified period as requested by CBC or Cell Broadcast Center Function

(CBCF).

The CMAS part of the PWS enables operators in general to offer a warning broadcast

service as a competitive advantage. Users with CMAS-capable UEs can get warning

alerts based on their geographical position with higher than cell-level

granularity.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitations

- If the TermPointToGNBCUCP MO in the GNBDUFunction MO class needs to be locked, the PWS request cannot be handled in the gNodeB. When the TermPointToGNBCUCP MO is unlocked again, no notification is sent to AMF and CBC, or Cell Broadcast Center Function (CBCF).
- Enabling the dynamic configuration of nRTAC can affect PWS service. When NRCellDU.nRTAC or AdditionalPLMNInfo.nRTAC is dynamically changed, due to non-synchronized TAI lists between gNodeB and CBC or CBCF, PWS messages may not be distributed as expected, or get distributed when they are supposed to be stopped. After the TAI lists are synchronized again, new PWS messages can work as intended.

Network Requirements

It is recommended that only one of the MOCN or MORAN Shared Network Operators

provides the CBC or CBCF node for the PWS service.

Broadcast and Scheduling of Notifications

## 3.1 Transmission of a Public Warning Message

The transmission of a public warning message consists of the following steps:

1. The AMF sends the NGAP WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST on the NG-C interface to the gNodeB. The NGAP content is checked to determine if an ETWS primary message, an ETWS secondary message, or a CMAS message is received.Note: Sending of ETWS primary and secondary notification in the same message is supported. If the gNodeB receives more than one NGAP WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST messages, the new request is handled after the ongoing Write-Replace procedure is finished.
2. The gNodeB sends back the NGAP WRITE-REPLACE WARNING RESPONSE on the NG-C interface to the AMF. The gNodeB handles duplication detection based on message identifiers in the NGAP WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST and the relevant cells. A duplicated message is not sent out, but a successful response is sent back to the AMF.
3. The gNodeB segments the warning message into several SIB7s or SIB8s, if needed.
4. The gNodeB schedules the message according to the received Repetition Period and Number of Broadcasts parameters.
5. The DCI is set during one full paging cycle after the paging cycle in which it was started.
6. The SIB1 with the scheduling information is broadcast to the UEs in the given area on the Uu interface. The UEs read the DCI with the PWS indication and the SIB1 for the scheduling information.
7. The corresponding SIB is broadcast to the UEs. SIB6 ETWS primary notification SIB7 ETWS secondary notification SIB8 CMAS notification
8. The broadcast is repeated for every CBC repetition, or in case of the ETWS primary notification, a time value can be set.
9. The UE reads the PWS message.

## 3.2 Cancellation of a Public Warning Message

The cancellation of a public warning message consists of the following steps:

1. The AMF sends the NGAP PWS CANCEL REQUEST on the NG-C interface.
2. The gNodeB identifies the messages to be canceled and the area where they need to be canceled.
3. The gNodeB sends the NGAP PWS CANCEL RESPONSE on the NG-C interface.
4. SIB1 is updated to stop the scheduling of the message.
5. DCI is set to reflect the change in the system information.

## 3.3 PWS Failure and Restart Indication Procedures

The PWS Failure Indication procedure is triggered if an individual cell fails.

The following cases trigger the PWS Restart Indication procedure:

- The gNodeB restarts.
- All NG-C links that are used for PWS Failure and Restart report breaks, and at least one of them become operational again.
- An individual cell restarts after a PWS Failure Indication procedure is triggered in the cell.
- A new cell or node is available.

The TermPointToAmf.pwsRestartHandling

attribute

must be set to ENABLED for the AMFs that have

connection to CBC or CBCF to enable the failure and restart reporting from NG RAN. When

the NG-C links, which are enabled

through

the TermPointToAmf.pwsRestartHandling attribute, break, and all the

links connected to the AMFs are unavailable, the NG RAN cannot receive messages from the

CBC or CBCF, such as the NGAP PWS CANCEL REQUEST message. As a result,

the ongoing PWS broadcast stops.

PWS Failure Indication

The PWS Failure Indication procedure consists of the following steps:

1. The gNodeB sends the NGAP PWS FAILURE INDICATION message on the NG-C interface to inform the AMF that an ongoing PWS operation for one or more cells has failed.
2. The AMF updates the CBC or CBCF about the cell status.

The gNodeB sends the NGAP PWS FAILURE INDICATION only if PWS messages

are scheduled in a cell.

PWS Restart Indication

The PWS Restart Indication procedure consists of the following steps:

1. The gNodeB sends the NGAP PWS RESTART INDICATION message on the NG-C interface in the following cases: Note: The message includes TAIs from all MOCN operators.
    - To notify the AMF about node and cell restart
    - If all of the links that are enabled through the TermPointToAmf.pwsRestartHandling breaks and at least one of the broken links becomes operational again.
2. The AMF informs the CBC or CBCF that the gNodeB lost all PWS information and they can be broadcast again.
3. The CBC or CBCF resends the lost PWS warning notifications, if needed.

The gNodeB also sends the NGAP PWS RESTART INDICATION, if a new cell

or node is available.

## 3.4 Warning Area Mapping

A Warning Area list is included in the incoming NGAP messages, NGAP WRITE-REPLACE

WARNING REQUEST, and

NGAP PWS CANCEL REQUEST. The area where the PWS message is to be

broadcast or canceled can be specified by the following information:

- NR Cell IDs
- TAIs for warning
- Emergency Area IDs The NR cells belonging to a certain emergency area are tagged with a reference to that area in the NRCellCU.pwsEmergencyAreaIdList. One cell can belong to maximum 15 emergency areas.

## 3.5 Broadcast and Scheduling of Notifications

### 3.5.1 Broadcast and Scheduling of ETWS Primary Notification

The GNBDUFunction.pwsEtwsPrimaryInd parameter defines the length of

time SIB6 is broadcast in the gNodeB. It is expressed in the number of paging cycles.

With the default settings of the ETWS primary notification, SIB6 is broadcast during

10.24 s and there are 64 transmissions of SIB6. Each SIB6 fits into the ETWS primary

notification without segmentation.

The siPeriodicity member of the SibTypePws

struct in the NRCellDU.sibType6 attribute defines the periodicity of

the SI message to which SIB6 is mapped.

Figure 2 shows an example how SIB6 can be

broadcast with default configuration settings.

Figure 2   Example of SIB6 Broadcast

Line A shows the repetitions of SIB1.

Line B shows the scheduling of SIB6 that starts after the inclusion of the SIB6

scheduling information in SIB1.

The line marked with C and D shows the following notification cases to a particular

UE:

1. The UE reads the Short Message included in the DCI.
2. The UE reads SIB1 to find out the scheduling information for SIB6.
3. The UE reads SIB6. When a UE reads a complete SIB6, the UE stops reading more SIB6 unless a new DCI indication is set.

Line E shows the paging cycles in relation to the DCI setting. DCI indication starts

after SIB1 has included the SIB6 scheduling information and continues for a full paging

cycle and a marginal paging cycle. In this example, the assumed value of the parameter

Paging.defaultPagingCycle is 1.28 s.

### 3.5.2 Broadcast and Scheduling of ETWS Secondary Notification

The broadcast of SIB1 and SIB7 lasts until a completed paging cycle, with an extra

broadcast of SIB7, containing the complete message.

The ETWS secondary notification might be segmented. Each SIB7 carries one segment and can

be broadcast in a separate SI message. These SI messages are broadcast in sequence.

The total broadcast time of the ETWS secondary notification is the product of

Repetition Period and Number of Broadcasts

Requested IEs.

The siPeriodicity member of the SibType struct

in the NRCellDU.sibType7 attribute defines the periodicity of the SI

message to which SIB7 is mapped.

Figure 3 shows an example how SIB7 can be

broadcast with default configuration settings.

Figure 3   Example of SIB7 Broadcast

Line A shows the repetitions of SIB1.

Line B shows the scheduling of SIB7 after the inclusion of the SIB7 scheduling

information in SIB1.

The line marked with C and D shows the following notification cases to a particular

UE:

1. The UE reads the Short Message included in the DCI.
2. The UE reads SIB1 to find out the scheduling information for SIB7.
3. The UE reads SIB7.

When a UE reads a complete SIB7, it stops reading more SIB7 unless a new DCI

indication is set.

Line E shows the paging cycles. DCI notification does not restart until the repetition

period timer expires or a new message is received. In this example, the assumed value of

the parameter Paging.defaultPagingCycle is 1.28 s.

### 3.5.3 Broadcast and Scheduling of CMAS Message

The total broadcast time of the CMAS message is the product of Repetition

Period and Number of Broadcasts Requested IEs.

Several CMAS messages with different contents can be broadcast concurrently, but one

complete message at a time. The CMAS messages might be segmented. Each SIB8 carries one

segment and can be broadcast in a separate SI message. These SI messages are broadcast

in sequence.

The siPeriodicity member of the SibType struct

in the NRCellDU.sibType8 attribute defines the periodicity of the SI

message to which SIB8 is mapped.

Figure 4 shows an example how SIB8 can be

broadcasted with default configuration settings.

Figure 4   Example of SIB8 Broadcast

Line A shows the repetitions of SIB1.

Line B shows the scheduling of SIB8 when two concurrent messages are transmitted within

the same repetition period. The scheduling starts after the inclusion of the SIB8

scheduling information in SIB1.

The line marked with C and D shows the following notification cases to a particular

UE:

1. The UE reads the Short Message included in the DCI.
2. The UE reads SIB1 to find out the scheduling information for SIB8.
3. The UE reads SIB8 until notified by the DCI that SIB1 needs to be read again. This time, the SIB1 does not contain the SIB8 scheduling information.

Line E shows the paging cycles. DCI notification does not restart until the repetition

period timer expires or a new message is received. In this example, the assumed value of

the parameter Paging.defaultPagingCycle is 1.28 s.

# 4 Network Impact of NR Public Warning System

The feature impacts the network performance if warning messages received from the

core network are active in a cell. The NGAP, RRC, and F1AP interfaces are updated to support

the feature.

Capacity and Performance

Additional System Information messages are broadcast, if warning messages received

from the core network are active in a cell. The impact on the downlink air interface

capacity depends on the periodicity of the system information messages and the

settings of the repetition parameters for the warning message.

Interfaces

The following messages are introduced on the NG-C interface:

- WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST
- WRITE-REPLACE WARNING RESPONSE
- PWS CANCEL REQUEST
- PWS CANCEL RESPONSE
- PWS RESTART INDICATION
- PWS FAILURE INDICATION

The following SIBs are updated on the Uu interface:

- SIB1
- SIB6
- SIB7
- SIB8

The Short Message fields in DCI are used for informing UEs about

updates related to the PWS. The etwsAndCmasIndication value is set

when the PWS transmission is initiated. The systemInfoModification

value is set when the PWS broadcast end.

The following messages are introduced on the F1-C interface:

- WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST
- WRITE-REPLACE WARNING RESPONSE
- PWS CANCEL REQUEST
- PWS CANCEL RESPONSE
- PWS RESTART INDICATION
- PWS FAILURE INDICATION

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for NR Public Warning System

## 8.1 Configuring RAN and CBC or CBCF

NR cell IDs and TAIs must have consistent setup in RAN and CBC or CBCF configurations. If

an NR cell ID or a TAI is updated in the RAN configuration, the same update must be done

in the CBC or CBCF configuration.

## 8.2 Configure AMFs for PWS Failure and Restart Handling

It is recommended to configure all the AMFs that have connection to CBC or Cell

Broadcast Center Function (CBCF) in the following way to support the PWS Restart and

Failure Handling procedures:

Steps

1. Set the TermPointToAmf.pwsRestartHandling attribute to ENABLED. Note: Configure minimum 2 AMFs in each AMF region to have a connection to CBC or Cell Broadcast Center Function (CBCF). For more information, see 3GPP TS 23.527 5G; 5G System; Restoration Procedures. If considerable amount of AMFs are connected to both CBC or Cell Broadcast Center Function (CBCF), and the NG-RAN, the TermPointToAmf.pwsRestartHandling attribute must not be set for all AMFs to reduce the load in a network. In this case, the configuration must be implemented with caution to guarantee the end-to-end service.

## 8.3 Modify Segmentation for NR Public Warning System

An FDD or TDD cell configured with either:

- SI Window Length of 5 slots,
- 5 MHz BW and an SI Window Length of 10 slots, or
- ESS with shorter SI Window Length than the recommended 80 slots

will require a modification of the segmentation into one or more instances of

SIB7/SIB8.

In case the existing cell configurations require such modification, contact next level of

support.
