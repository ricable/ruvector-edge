Summary

The feature gives priority to robust system control

signaling and retransmissions over user data. Users can be multiplexed and scheduled

in time, efficiently using spectral and hardware resources to optimize user

throughput and cell capacity.

Scheduling is done dynamically for every slot. For every

upcoming slot, the Scheduler determines which users are assigned radio interface and

radio node resources.

The Scheduler is a basic feature, and it is a part of radio resource management.

The single-user scenario applies single-layer data transmission. The scheduler

transmits one code word for each physical layer to choose MCSs for downlink or

uplink transmissions.

The feature allows multiple users to schedule downlink and uplink user-plane traffic

in cells that include multiple DRBs for

each UE.

The Scheduler feature also supports the following functions:

- Timing alignment
- Uplink scheduling triggered by a Scheduling Request (SR) on PUCCH
- Increased robustness of small downlink data

# 2 Dependencies of Scheduler Mid-Band

The Scheduler Mid-Band feature is related to features that can affect the scheduling

process, and features that can affect MCS selection.

Table 1   Feature Dependencies

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Limitations

The increased robustness of small downlink data function

converts padding bits to coding bits only in type 0 downlink resource allocation.

Network Requirements

It is required to use ENM version 23.2 or

later to support the MOM changes introduced by the increased robustness of small

downlink data function.

# 3 Feature Operation of Scheduler Mid-Band

The scheduler

prioritizes and allocates resources for the radio network based on input from the

operator.

Operational

Process

1. If data is available on downlink data transmission, downlink scheduling candidates are sent to the mid-band scheduler.
2. Uplink scheduling candidates are sent to the mid-band scheduler for every possible uplink slot.
3. At the beginning of each slot, the mid-band scheduler receives scheduling candidates and information on radio resources.
4. If resources are available and there are relevant downlink or uplink scheduling candidates, the mid-band scheduler allocates an appropriate amount of resources to the UE. PRBs are allocated as scheduling elements to available slots.

## 3.1 Scheduling Request for Mid-Band

A Scheduling Request (SR) is used by the UE for requesting PUSCH resources for a new

PUSCH transmission.

In NR, the SR is configured on the logical channel level, not on the UE level as in

LTE.

The MAC entity can be configured with zero, one, or more SRs. An SR configuration

consists of a set of PUCCH resources for SRs across different BWPs and cells. For each

logical channel, one PUCCH resource is configured per BWP for SRs.

The number of PRBs used for PUCCH format 1 is dynamically increased when there are many

connected UEs and more SR resources are necessary. To achieve this, PRBs initially used

for PUSCH are temporarily converted to PUCCH. This results in better uplink resource use

and higher PUSCH throughput when the number of connected UEs is lower.

Initially, one PUCCH PRB pair is available for SRs at cell unlock. When

SR resources from this first PRB pair are exhausted, more PRB pairs are configured

dynamically for PUCCH. PRBs are taken from PUSCH for this reason. UE grouping and 5QI

configuration are not considered in SR resource allocation.

For SR resource allocation, UEs can be assigned to the following SR

periodicity pools:

- Short
- Common
- Maximum

The process of assigning UEs to the SR periodicity pools is handled with the

following logic in the order of the UEs connecting to the network:

1. The first UE to connect to the network gets SR periodicity resources from the short SR periodicity pool.
2. If the short pool is exhausted, the UEs that connect afterward are assigned resources from the common SR periodicity pool.
3. If the common pool is exhausted, all further UEs that connect are assigned SR periodicity resources from the maximum SR periodicity pool.

By default, SRs have high priority. SR priority can be configured using the

QoS-controlled SR scheduling function of the QoS Framework feature.

## 3.2 Scheduling Channels

The feature uses different resources in the downlink and the uplink

channels.

Table 2   Resources for Downlink and Uplink Scheduling

| Direction   | Resources                                                            | Description                                                                                                       |

(1)

CSI-RS is used for the TRS only

## 3.3 Data Transmission

The feature

only supports a specific set of Time Division Duplex (TDD)

patterns.

In TDD, downlink and uplink are transmitted over the same frequency band. The resources

are divided in time on slot level between the uplink and the downlink.

The following TDD patterns are supported with special slot configurations for each

pattern:

- 3 downlink + 1 uplink (default)
- 4 downlink + 1 uplink
- 4 downlink + 1 uplink + 3 downlink + 2 uplink
- 4 downlink + 2 uplink + 4 downlink
- 8 downlink + 2 uplink

Figure 2   Supported TDD Patterns

A special slot can contain the following symbols:

- Downlink
- Uplink
- Guard

## 3.4 Scheduling Priority in Mid-Band

The feature determines which UEs are assigned resources in each slot of each

cell.

Scheduling is based on the scheduling weight attached to the DRBs. The user with the

longer scheduling delay is to be scheduled earlier.

Uplink control information is prioritized if uplink signal quality is

not favorable. In this way, performance information is prioritized instead of uplink

data throughput.

HARQ

In NR, HARQ has the following characteristics both in the downlink and in the

uplink:

| Asynchronous   |    | No predefined timing for retransmissions occurs.     The number of HARQ processes is explicitly indicated in                                         DCI.   |
|----------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                |    |                                                                                                                                                             |
| Adaptive       |    | HARQ retransmission requires an uplink grant or a downlink                             assignment.                                                          |

HARQ ACK is sent on PUCCH and multiplexed on PUSCH, with or without uplink SCH.

## 3.5 Process Steps for Downlink Scheduling

Downlink

scheduling involves reserving resources for downlink user plane data based on prevailing

conditions.

Steps

1. At the beginning of each slot, the Scheduler receives the following information: List of available PRBs and symbols for PDSCH PDCCH resources Scheduling candidates for transmitting data Estimate of current radio conditions Number of OFDM symbols for user data transmission
2. The network transmits downlink data for the UE, triggering scheduling requests that can be scheduled at the selected slot. In downlink, scheduling candidates are based on downlink buffer status.
3. The Scheduler assigns an appropriate number of PRBs to the UE with any selected MCS. The MCS allows one code word to be transmitted over the air with up to four downlink layers.
4. Scheduling information is sent to the UE through a downlink grant with the format DCI1\_1 at PDCCH, transmitted at the same slot as for PDSCH transmission (k0=0).
5. The PUCCH resources and one of the configured timings (K1) for the HARQ-ACK feedback of the UE is indicated in the same downlink grant.

## 3.6 Process Steps for Uplink Scheduling

Uplink scheduling involves reserving resources for uplink user plane data based on

prevailing conditions.

Steps

1. At the beginning of each slot, the Scheduler receives the following information: List of available PRBs, and symbols for PUSCH Candidates to be scheduled in uplink with data to transmit Estimate of current radio conditions (channel quality) Number of OFDM symbols for user data transmission PUCCH and PRACH have absolute priority over other control and user data channels in the uplink. The scheduling element resources for uplink scheduling are not used by PUCCH and PRACH.
2. When a UE is scheduled in a slot, the Scheduler allocates resources to the UE. For the uplink, scheduling candidates are either prescheduled or determined by the BSR.
3. The Scheduler sends a scheduling grant to the scheduled UE with the DCI format DCI0\_1. This also indicates one of the configured timings from the grant to the assigned uplink slot (K2). Uplink grants are sent on PDCCH. A selected MCS and one layer are indicated in the uplink grant. Uplink scheduling can be triggered by the following grants: A scheduling grant after content resolution message using BSR A grant triggered by prescheduling at low-load scenarios A Scheduling Request (SR) triggered grant
4. The UE transmits the uplink data on the scheduled PRBs at the desired uplink slot to the node.

## 3.7 Scheduling Algorithm in Mid-Band

Summary

Resource-fair scheduling is used. Multiple downlink and uplink scheduling candidates

are sent to the mid-band scheduler. In the downlink, scheduling candidates are based

on downlink buffer status. In the uplink, devices are scheduled either based on the

PUCCH scheduling request, the BSR, or prescheduling.

An increased number of PDSCH and PUSCH scheduling entities requires the support of

PDCCH resources. Downlink and uplink PDCCH scheduling entities are supported in each

slot and cell. In the downlink, link adaptation allows for processing scheduling

entities in each slot and cell.

The allocation of downlink and uplink scheduling entities in each slot provides the

opportunity to decrease the RTT latency when there are more connected users. Lower

latency can provide increased TCP throughput.

NR PDCCH Link Adaptation

The PDCCH Link Adaptation allocates CCEs for the DCI transmission based on the

channel quality and how the NRCellDU.pdcchLaSinrOffset parameter

is set. The PDCCH Link Adaptation uses higher aggregation levels to reduce coding

rate and extend PDCCH coverage. The PDCCH Link Adaptation can use lower aggregation

levels to avoid unnecessary PDCCH resource consumption, improving PDCCH

capacity.

## 3.8 Measurement Gap Handling for Scheduler Low-Band and Mid-Band

UEs can be configured with a measurement gap in

EN-DC,

NR-DC, and NR standalone

deployments.

If

the UE is configured with a measurement gap, the UE is not scheduled for downlink and

uplink transmission during the measurement gap, except for the Random Access

procedure. If the measurement gap prevents the scheduling requests

from registering, the scheduling request resources are reconfigured.

UEs that support measurement gap requirement information reporting can be requested to

report if a measurement gap is required for NR intra-system measurements.

In an EN-DC configuration, the measurement gap is transferred to the Secondary Node

scheduler if the measurement gap is configured or removed for the frequencies of the

serving cells in the SCG.

In an NR-DC configuration, the measurement gap on the Master Node is only forwarded to

the Secondary Node scheduler if the measurement gap is configured for all

frequencies,

and the measurement gap configuration is changed.

For more information, see Measurement Gap-Aware NR Scheduling.

## 3.9 Increased Robustness of Small Downlink Data

The increased robustness of small downlink data function reduces MCS for small

downlink data.

Padding bits for small data transmissions cause high BLER for all services and high

packet loss for VoNR. The robustness of small downlink data transmissions can be

increased by reducing MCS during link adaptation, which leads to the conversion of

padding bits to coding bits.

Enabling the increased robustness of small downlink data function decreases downlink HARQ

BLER and VoNR packet loss, along with more robust small downlink data transmissions.

MCS reduction is only possible if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- Type 0 downlink resource allocation is used.
- MCS Table 1 or MCS Table 2 is used.

The function might increase the number of downlink RLC retransmissions. The increased

number of downlink RLC retransmissions can be observed through the

NRCellDU.pmRlcArqDlNack PM counter.

## 3.10 PUSCH Power Control

The feature can simplify the P0 value adaptation, which optimizes the power control

configuration.

The feature can simplify the P0 value adaptation, which optimizes the power control

configuration. The P0 value is the initial uplink received PSD power of every connected

UE for the first transmission.

The value can be set manually or automatically, using the

NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant attribute.

When the value of the NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant attribute is set to

1000, the system selects a P0 value for the

NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschAutoSelected attribute.

The P0 value is optimized for every radio deployment and aims to

maintain peak uplink throughput and to reduce interference, as well as to prevent

network imbalances. The optimization is based on the radio

unit, the value of

the NRSectorCarrier.noOfUsedRxAntennas attribute,

and the value of the NRCellDU.autoSelectedModeOffset attribute, which

can increase or lower the P0 value. The

automatically

selected P0 value is calculated

for each

particular antenna

deployment at cell

setup and cell reconfiguration. The selected value is applied as the

initial uplink received PSD power for PUSCH transmissions.

The NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant and the

NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschAutoSelected attributes can be used for

both the open-loop and closed-loop power control. For open-loop power control, the

transmission power is determined by the UE. When the NR Closed-Loop Power Control

Low/Mid-Band feature is active, the gNodeB can instruct the UE to adjust the

transmission power. For more information, see: NR Closed-Loop Power Control Low/Mid-Band.

When the value of the NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant attribute is set to

another value from 1000, the value of the

NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschAutoSelected attribute is cleared, because

the automated selection of a P0 value is no longer needed.

The value of the NRCellDU.autoSelectedModeOffset attribute, which

provides additional offset, can be configured depending on the network conditions to

prioritize either interference mitigation or the maintenance of peak uplink throughput.

This value controls the uplink received PSD targets of the gNodeB when closed-loop power

control is used, for both the manually set and the auto-selected P0 nominal values.

The default value of the attribute is 6 dB. This means that when the default value is

used, a margin is given for a 6 dB rise of IpN (interference + noise added for each

PRB). For example, if the IpN is -120 dBm/PRB, 6 dB added as offset means an IpN target

level of -114 dBm.

The NRCellDU.autoSelectedModeOffset attribute can be configured in the

following ways for optimization:

- When throughput is a concern, increasing the value of the attribute, depending on the deployment, can help to maintain peak uplink throughput.
- When uplink interference is a concern, decreasing the value of the attribute, depending on the deployment, can help mitigating the effects of the interference.

When the value of the NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant attribute is set to

1000, the value set for the

NRCellDU.autoSelectedModeOffset attribute affects the value of

the NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschAutoSelected attribute. Changing the value

of the NRCellDU.autoSelectedModeOffset attribute by 1 dB affects the

uplink received PSD target of the gNodeB when the NR Closed-Loop Power Control

Low/Mid-Band feature is active by 1 dB. However, as the P0 value transmitted to the UE

can only be an even number, the change might not be apparent in the value of the

NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschAutoSelected attribute. The uplink received

PSD target of the gNodeB for uplink closed-loop power control is still updated by 1 dB,

which can be used to fine-tune the targets of the gNodeB. For more information, see

3GPP TS 38.331 Release 16 and 3GPP TS 38.213 Release

16.

# 4 Network Impact of Scheduler Mid-Band

The

feature ensures efficient resource assignment for UEs. The scheduling of resources is based

on the current channel condition and buffer status.

Capacity and Performance

The activation of the increased robustness of small downlink

data function decreases the downlink MAC cell throughput without degrading user perception, as

MCS is expected to decrease for small data. The function converts padding bits to coding bits

in small data transmissions, which decreases downlink HARQ BLER and VoNR packet loss. Downlink

HARQ BLER for 64-QAM and 256-QAM might increase, although downlink HARQ BLER decreases.

If the increased robustness of small downlink data function is enabled, the downlink

MCG and SCG radio resource switching might increase, so the

GNBCUUPFunction.pmPdcpRadioResSwitchDlMcg and the

GNBCUUPFunction.pmPdcpRadioResSwitchDlScg PM counters might

also increase.

Network

Impact of Scheduling Entities Number

The number of PDSCH and PUSCH scheduling entities is related to the RTT latency. The

increased

number of scheduling entities can decrease the RTT latency if the number of

connected users is high, so the number of active UEs can be reduced because of

faster scheduling. Lower latency can provide increased TCP throughput.

The MAC resource use in downlink and in uplink can be increased for the slots that

have sufficient available resources. The downlink and uplink MAC cell throughput can

also be increased depending on traffic characteristics.

The increased number of PDSCH and PUSCH scheduling entities can result in more PDCCH

blocking if PDCCH

resources

are limited, especially for a cell with smaller bandwidth,

fewer

PDCCH symbols, and if some UEs are in poor radio condition

requiring relatively higher CCE aggregation level.

The number of symbols that can be allocated to PDCCH is determined by the

value

allowed to be set in the

NRCellDU.pdcchSymbConfig attribute. For more information, see

NR Multiple PDCCH Symbols Low/Mid-Band. Increased PDCCH

blocking can lead to increased scheduling latency for UEs in poor radio

condition.

The increased number of PDSCH or PUSCH scheduling entities can result in more

frequent RLC ACK/NACK in the opposite direction for RLC AM bearers. This can

slightly increase the scheduling latency in the opposite direction. If the number of

scheduling entities is also increased in the opposite direction, this scheduling

latency issue can be solved or mitigated.

For more information on

SE/TTI

values regarding specific hardware units and configurations, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR

RAN.

Network

Impact of the Scheduler Mid-Band Feature Working with the NR Intelligent Temperature

Handling feature

The NR Intelligent Temperature Handling feature

forcefully

blanks some PDSCH slots if the gaps between downlink traffic bursts are not enough

to fulfill the requests of the radio unit. These slots are counted by the

NRCellDU.pmRadioPdschEmptySlotsForced PM counter. Because

temperature change is a slower process compared to slot scheduling, the downlink

PDSCH scheduling algorithm does not need to react immediately. It can select which

PDSCH slot to forcefully blank. Forcefully blanked slots result in increased

downlink latency. Peak downlink throughput and downlink cell capacity are also

reduced.

In case the gaps between traffic bursts allow enough empty slots, the NR Intelligent

Temperature Handling feature uses these empty slots to fulfill the request of the

radio unit. In this case, there is no impact on capacity and throughput.

For more information, see NR Intelligent Temperature Handling.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

The NR Intelligent Temperature Handling feature can degrade the KPIs for downlink

latency, cell, and UE downlink throughput in a minimal way. The number of forcefully

blanked slots indicates the grade of impact on these KPIs.

Counters

In general, the scheduling works at MAC layer, thus, the MAC layer PM counters under

the NRCellDU MO can be used to observe the scheduling

performance.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

## Appendix A.c: 23.Q2: Increased Number of Downlink Scheduling Entities for Scheduler Mid-Band

This feature enhancement allows an increased number of scheduling entities per TTI in

the

downlink.

| Feature Name:           | Scheduler Mid-Band   |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4906         |

| Impact at Upgrade:      | Mandatory            |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement potentially increases the number of scheduling entities in

the downlink for select CPRI TDD-capable Radio configurations. This can result in

the following observable benefits depending on traffic characteristics:

- Improved downlink scheduling latency
- Improved overall cell downlink throughput

Capacity and Performance

The improvement has the greatest effect on the network when downlink scheduling

capability is the bottleneck for performance. As a result, the DL active UE KPI is

expected to decrease. This is because UEs are not required to keep waiting for as

long as before to be scheduled.

The following PM counters can be used to observe the benefits of the feature

enhancement:

- Related to downlink PRB use: NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUtilDlDistr NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUtilDlMax
- Related to the increased downlink scheduling capability: NRCellDU.pmMacVolDl NRCellDU.pmPdschSchedActivity NRCellDU.pmPdschSchedEntityDistr

## Appendix A.d: 23.Q3: Increased Robustness of Small Downlink Data Transmissions

The feature enhancement increases the robustness of small downlink data transmissions

by converting padding bits to coding bits.

| Feature Name           | Scheduler Low-Band   | Scheduler Mid-Band   |
|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5038         | FAJ 121 4906         |

| Access Type            | NR                   | NR                   |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional             | Optional             |

Summary and Benefits

Downlink resource allocation works with padding bits for small data transmissions,

which leads to high BLER for all services and high packet loss for VoNR. The feature

enhancement converts the padding bits to coding bits, which increases the robustness

of downlink small data transmissions. As a result, downlink HARQ BLER and VoNR

packet loss decrease.

As the MCS distribution is expected to shift from higher to lower bins, downlink MAC

cell throughput is expected to decrease without degrading user perception.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits on downlink:

- Packet loss for VoNR is expected to decrease.
- HARQ BLER is expected to decrease in average and lower modulations.
- Transport ratio is expected to increase for QPSK and 16-QAM.
- HARQ DTX rate for QPSK is expected to decrease.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement decreases the following KPIs:

- Normalized Average DL MAC Cell Throughput Considering Traffic
- Normalized DL MAC Cell Throughput Considering Actual PDSCH Slot Only
- Average DL Throughput per NRCellDU
- DL Packet Loss Captured in gNodeB

The feature enhancement decreases the rate of unsuccessful HARQ transmissions and the

rate of unsuccessful discontinuous transmissions for QPSK due to the modulation

shift, which can be observed with the following PIs:

- DL HARQ BLER %
- DL HARQ DTX Rate for QPSK

MCS distribution shift from higher bins to lower bins can be monitored with the

following PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmRadioPdschTable1McsDistr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioPdschTable2McsDistr

Downlink MAC volume transmitted in the secondary cell can decrease, which can be

monitored with the following PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlSCell
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlSCellExt

Downlink MAC volume offloaded to the secondary cell can decrease, which can be

monitored with the following PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmMacOffloadVolDlSCell
- NRCellDU.pmMacOffloadVolDlSCellExt

Downlink PDCP packet integrity is not expected to degrade, which can be monitored

with the following PM counters:

- RpUserPlaneLink.pmPdcpPktTransDlQos
- RpUserPlaneLink.pmPdcpPktTransDlAckQos

The feature enhancement might increase downlink MCG and SCG radio resource switching,

which might increase the following PM counters:

- GNBCUUPFunction.pmPdcpRadioResSwitchDlMcg
- GNBCUUPFunction.pmPdcpRadioResSwitchDlScg

This feature enhancement might increase the number of downlink RLC

retransmissions,which might increase the NRCellDU.pmRlcArqDlNack

PM counter.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the

NRCellDU.dlSmallDataRobustness attribute, which is used to

enable or disable the feature enhancement.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 23.2 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions
