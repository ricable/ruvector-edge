Summary

The LTE-NR Dual Connectivity (FAJ 121 4908) feature

introduces support for E-UTRA - NR Dual Connectivity (EN-DC) in the gNodeB being the

Secondary Node in the EN-DC deployment.

EN-DC is realized as the combination of the following features and system

functions:

- Basic Intelligent Connectivity (FAJ 121 4843)
- LTE-NR Dual Connectivity (FAJ 121 4908)
- LTE carrier aggregation
- NR carrier aggregation

With the LTE-NR Dual Connectivity feature activated, SCG radio resources provided by the

Secondary Node (gNodeB) in the EN-DC deployment can be set up for the EN-DC-capable

UE in NR coverage.

The benefits of the EN-DC deployment are the following:

- Higher peak rate of network data traffic by aggregating LTE and NR carriers.
- Sustainable capacity and performance growth.

Additional Information

For more information on EN-DC deployment, see the following documentation:

- 3GPP TS 37.716 specifications "E-UTRA - NR Dual Connectivity of x bands"

![Image](../images/5_22104-LZA7016017_1Uen.VH33B/additional_3_CP.png)

Hardware Requirements

The LTE-NR Dual Connectivity feature is supported on all Baseband units supporting

NR.

Limitations

- Both the Master Node and the Secondary Node must be time and phase synchronized either using GNSS or the IEEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization feature. A less strict accuracy of 500 μs can be used with the Partial Timing Support (PTS) with relaxed network limits enhancement. In addition, both of the nodes have to have the same frame start offset. For more information, see Manage Network Synchronization. If EN-DC is deployed without the time synchronization feature, EN-DC setup is only guaranteed between LTE cells and NR cells if either of the following conditions is met: Both the LTE cells and the NR cells are on the same Baseband Radio Node. The LTE cells and the NR cells are synchronized by the means of Node Group Synchronization. If the node is deployed without the IEEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization feature, the Sync Time and Phase Accuracy Too Low alarm is raised. Because of this, it is recommended to activate the IEEE 1588 Time and Phase Synchronization feature in EN-DC deployments.
- Intra-band carrier aggregation in EN-DC is only supported with the following 3GPP operating bands: B41 for LTE n41 for NR Note: Intra-band carrier aggregation is blocked when the Master Node is set to NR-preferred carrier aggregation and to block intra-band EN-DC.
- Packet forwarding is not supported for Secondary Node terminated DRBs during RRC connection re-establishment.
- For LTE mobility without PSCell change, the following limitations apply: No bearer type transition occurs during handover. SGW relocation for Secondary Node-terminated DRBs results in Secondary Node release.
- LTE uplink carrier aggregation is not used in EN-DC.

Network Requirements

- The LTE-NR Dual Connectivity feature requires the S1AP E-RAB Modification Indication procedure to be supported in the EPC.
- The RLC mode for a specific QCI defined in the Master Node has to reflect the corresponding setting in the Secondary Node. For the Secondary Node, the RLC mode for a QCI is set using the CUCP5qi.rlcMode attribute for the corresponding 5QI in the CUCP5qiTable MO instance. This MO instance must have the CUCP5qiTable.default5qiTable attribute set to true if the CUCP5qi.profile5qi attribute has a value configured that is equal to either of the following attribute values set on the Master Node: QciProfileOperatorDefined.qci QciProfilePredefined.qci

# 3 Feature Operation of LTE-NR Dual Connectivity

## 3.1 EN-DC Deployment

EN-DC, covering the fundamental interaction between a Master Node (eNodeB) and a Secondary Node (gNodeB),

is realized as the combination of the following features and system functions:

- Basic Intelligent Connectivity
- LTE-NR Dual Connectivity
- LTE carrier aggregation
- NR carrier aggregation

The EN-DC-capable UE is always connected to the eNodeB, being

the Master Node in EN-DC. The UE can connect to the gNodeB,

being the Secondary Node in EN-DC, if the UE is within NR coverage. The UE is connected

both to the eNodeB and the gNodeB

through the Uu interface.

The eNodeB connects to the EPC through the S1 interface. The

S1-C interface is used for control plane, while the S1-U interface is used for user

plane.

The gNodeB connects to the EPC through the S1-U interface for

user plane.

The eNodeB and the gNodeB are connected

to each other through the X2 interface. The X2-C interface is used for control plane,

while the X2-U interface is used for user plane. One eNodeB can

be connected to several gNodeBs and one gNodeB can be connected to several eNodeBs.

Figure 1   Connection for the EN-DC-Capable UE

The following cell groups can serve the EN-DC-capable UE:

| Master Cell Group (MCG)    |    | The MCG, provided by the eNodeB, can consist of a                         Primary Cell (PCell) and zero or more Secondary Cells (SCells).            |
|----------------------------|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                            |    |                                                                                                                                                      |
| Secondary Cell Group (SCG) |    | The SCG, provided by the gNodeB, can consist of a                         Primary Secondary Cell (PSCell) and zero or more Secondary Cells (SCells). |

When the EN-DC-capable UE is connected to both the Master Node (eNodeB) and the Secondary Node (gNodeB), it has the following MCG and SCG radio resources for user plane traffic:

| Master Node terminated MCG DRBs      |    | Master Node terminated MCG DRBs are provided in the MCG and use LTE PDCP                         resources. These DRBs transmit user plane traffic between the UE and the eNodeB. Such DRBs terminate the user plane through                         the S1-U interface between the eNodeB and the EPC.                         Master Node terminated MCG DRBs are ciphered and deciphered in the Master                         Node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Secondary Node terminated split DRBs |    | Secondary Node terminated split DRBs are provided in the SCG and use NR PDCP                         resources. Following Secondary Node Addition, the split DRB can use MCG, SCG                         or both resources, depending on Secondary Node functionality. The use of the                         split DRB is determined based on whether the UE is in NR coverage or not.                         These bearers can transmit user plane traffic between the UE and the eNodeB or between the UE and the gNodeB, depending on the QCI configuration and NR                         link quality. Such DRBs terminate the user plane through the S1-U interface                         between the gNodeB and the EPC. Secondary Node                         terminated split DRBs are ciphered and deciphered in the Secondary Node. |

Figure 2   MCG and SCG Radio Resources in EN-DC

The UE uses either of the following combinations of radio resources when connected to

both nodes in EN-DC:

- Master Node terminated MCG DRBs and Secondary Node terminated split DRBs Such a case applies when the UE is in NR coverage and can use both MCG and SCG resources depending on the QCI configuration of the DRBs. Split is allowed for DRBs by configuration.
- Master Node terminated MCG DRBs and Secondary Node terminated MCG DRBs Such a case applies when the UE is only served by the MCG because of an SCG Release procedure. However, Secondary Node terminated MCG DRBs are also used when DRBs are not allowed to be split by configuration.

In EN-DC, the UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED mode in the eNodeB. The control of the UE is managed through the LTE RRC

signaling between the eNodeB and the UE. Information specific

to gNodeB resources is carried by containers conveying NR RRC

signaling over the X2-C and the LTE Uu interfaces.

The gNodeB resources, including a candidate NR cell, for the

EN-DC-capable UE are configured using the following procedures:

- Secondary Node Addition
- Secondary Cell Group Addition

The eNodeB selects a candidate NR cell using one of the

following methods:

| Configuration-based setup   |    | One candidate NR cell is referenced by the primary LTE cell serving the                         UE.                     |
|-----------------------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                             |    |                                                                                                                         |
| Measurement-based setup     |    | The eNodeB orders the UE to perform an LTE inter-RAT                         B1 measurement to find a suitable NR cell. |

With the gNodeB resources available to the EN-DC-capable UE, DRBs

can be reconfigured to become Secondary Node terminated split DRBs. With the DRBs

reconfigured to be split, the user plane provided to the UE is configured in the

following ways:

- Downlink traffic is transmitted through the gNodeB using SCG resources after a successful NR random access procedure. If the NR link quality falls below a configured threshold, downlink traffic is redirected to use MCG resources for the split DRB. Initial downlink transmission is done through SCG. However, the further use of SCG, MCG, or the combination of the two is determined by NR link quality and buffer age.
- Uplink traffic is transmitted either through the eNodeB using MCG resources or the gNodeB using SCG resources. The initial uplink transmission is configurable. However, the NR link quality determines the further use of MCG or SCG resources for uplink traffic.

In both directions, the Secondary Node terminated split DRB uses NR PDCP resources.

### 3.2.1 Secondary Node User Activity Supervision

The Secondary Node is responsible for monitoring user plane activity on the Secondary

Node terminated DRBs serving each UE.

When no user plane data is sent to or received from the UE on any of the Secondary Node

terminated DRBs for the amount of time configured through the

InactivityProfileUeCfg.tInactivityTimerEndcSn attribute, the

Secondary Node sends the X2AP SGNB ACTIVITY NOTIFICATION message to the

Master Node. The message indicates to the Master Node that the UE is inactive on

Secondary Node terminated DRBs.

If user plane data is sent to or received from the UE on any of the Secondary Node

terminated DRBs after the inactivity notification, the Secondary Node sends an

additional X2AP SGNB ACTIVITY NOTIFICATION message to the Master Node.

The message indicates to the Master Node that the UE is reactivated.

### 3.2.7 Handling the UAI Overheating Report by the Secondary Node

The UAI overheating report is forwarded by the Master Node to the Secondary

Node.

The forwarding is done by the Secondary Node Modification procedure.

If the UAI report is received, the Secondary Node performs one of the following

actions:

- Deactivating the SCells in the SCG
- Reactivating the SCells in the SCG

### 3.2.8 Handling of Allowed EN-DC Band Combination List Update

If the Secondary Node receives the X2AP SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST message

sent by the Master Node with the allowedBC-ListMRDC IE that contains the

currently selected BandCombinationIndex and

FeatureSetEntryIndex IEs, the allowed band combination list is

updated on the Secondary Node. Otherwise, the Secondary Node rejects the message.

If the inter-frequency PSCell candidates change because of an update to the allowed band

combination list, measurements for the following mobility functions can be reconfigured

after the Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure:

- Mobility Control at Poor Coverage for EN-DC
- Inter-Frequency PSCell Change to Higher Priority

## 3.3 EN-DC Bearer Type Transitions

Bearer type transitions in EN-DC are possible among the following DRB types:

- Master Node terminated MCG DRBs
- Secondary Node terminated split DRBs
- Secondary Node terminated MCG DRBs

The EN-DC-configured UE can be in one of the following states, depending on the

combination of the DRB types, as shown in Figure 3:

Table 2   EN-DC-Configured UE States with DRB Type Combination Used

| EN-DC-Configured UE State   | Combination of DRB Types                                                                                                                                         |

| B                           | This combination contains one or more Secondary Node terminated                                     split DRBs and zero or more Master Node terminated MCG DRBs. |
| C                           | This combination contains one or more Secondary Node terminated                                     MCG DRBs and zero or more Master Node terminated MCG DRBs.   |

1. UE Connection Setup The EN-DC-capable UE is connected only by using Master Node terminated MCG DRBs. Therefore, in the UE Connection Setup, user plane data is transmitted through the Master Node only.
2. Secondary Node Addition During the Secondary Node Addition procedure, one or more of the existing Master Node terminated MCG DRBs are reconfigured to Secondary Node terminated split DRBs.
3. SCG Release (Secondary Node Modification) During SCG Release, all Secondary Node terminated split DRBs are reconfigured to the Secondary Node terminated MCG DRBs. The SCG resources for the UE are released, but the PDCP context is kept in the Secondary Node.
4. SCG Addition (Secondary Node Modification) During SCG Addition, all Secondary Node terminated MCG DRBs are reconfigured to Secondary Node terminated Split DRBs.
5. Secondary Node Release During the Secondary Node Release Procedure, all Secondary Node terminated DRBs (split or MCG) are reconfigured to Master Node terminated MCG DRBs. All SCG resources for the UE are released. PDCP resources for the UE are relocated from the Secondary Node to the Master Node.

The UE can be released to RRC\_IDLE mode from any of the EN-DC-configured

UE states.

## 3.4 EN-DC Configuration

### 3.4.1 Dynamic Power Sharing

The uplink transmission power capability of the EN-DC-capable UE must be split between

the SCG radio resources and the MCG radio resources when the UE is configured with at

least one Secondary Node terminated split DRB. This is required if the UE is using an

EN-DC band combination with an NR band in Low-Band or Mid-Band.

If the UE is capable of dynamic power sharing on the used EN-DC band combination, the UE

manages its transmission power capability by itself. In Low-Band and Mid-Band, dynamic

power sharing allows the UE to configure the maximum uplink transmission power for both

MCG and SCG radio resources in steps of 1 dB.

If user data transmission for both MCG and SCG radio resources is scheduled at the same

time, transmission power is allocated in the following order:

1. Power is allocated first to the MCG radio resources.
2. The remaining power is allocated to the SCG radio resources.

The allocation of uplink transmission power ensures that the total uplink power

configured separately for the MCG and SCG radio resources is not exceeded.

If the UE is not capable of dynamic power sharing, the network needs to configure the UE

with a maximum uplink transmission power semi-statically for both the SCG and the MCG

radio resources.

The Secondary Node receives the maximum uplink transmission power for

the SCG resources over the X2 interface.

For more information on dynamic power sharing and UE power classes,

see the following documentation:

- 3GPP TS 38.101, NR; User Equipment (UE) Radio Transmission and Reception; Release 15
- 3GPP TS 38.331, NR; Radio Resource Control (RRC); Release 15

### 3.4.2 Switching of Downlink MCG and SCG Radio Resources of the Secondary Node Terminated Split DRB

The switching of downlink MCG and SCG radio resources of the Secondary Node terminated

split DRB allows downlink user plane transmission to conform to the estimated radio

quality of the NR link. The switching depends on the following conditions:

- When the estimated radio quality of the NR link is good, the downlink data transmission uses the SCG radio resources.
- When the estimated radio quality of the NR link is poor, the downlink data transmission uses the MCG radio resources.

The switching of downlink MCG and SCG resources can be adapted to rapidly changing radio

conditions. This is possible because it does not require the reconfiguration of the UE.

The trigger values for switching downlink MCG and SCG radio resources are

configurable.

To enable MCG and SCG radio resource switching in downlink, the

CgSwitchCfg.dlCgSwitchMode attribute must be set to

ENABLED in the serving NR cell.

The switching of downlink MCG and SCG resources is based on repeated

polling for estimated downlink radio quality and periodicity. The switching can be

configured for Low-Band and Mid-Band using the

CgSwitchCfg.dlScgNoDataAcsiPeriodicity attribute. To disable the

polling and MCG and SCG radio resource switching in downlink, the

CgSwitchCfg.dlCgSwitchMode attribute must be set to

false in the serving NR cell.

On High-Band, if switching happens from SCG to MCG due to poor radio conditions, two

consecutive CQI reports indicating good radio quality are needed until the switch back

to SCG is performed.

It is recommended to enable the NR Coverage Triggered Secondary Node Release function if

the switching of downlink MCG and SCG resources is disabled.

Table 3   Attributes to Configure Trigger Values for Switching Downlink MCG and SCG

Radio Resources

| CgSwitchCfg.dlScgLowQualThresh                 | The radio quality of the NR link is defined by the configured                                     threshold value of the attribute. The gNodeB switches to the MCG                                     radio resources if either of the following cases applies:  Two consecutive CQI measurements are made that are                                                 below the threshold.     Four consecutive CQI measurements are missing.     Unsent packets and upcoming packets are then transmitted                                     over the MCG radio resources. |
| CgSwitchCfg.dlScgNoDataAcsiPeriodicity         | The periodicity for repeated polling for estimated downlink radio                                     quality of SCG radio resources is defined by this attribute.

### 3.4.3 Switching of Uplink MCG and SCG Radio Resources of the Secondary Node Terminated Split DRB

The switching of uplink MCG and SCG radio resources of the Secondary Node-terminated

split DRB allows uplink user plane transmission to conform to the estimated radio

quality of the NR link. The switching depends on the following conditions:

- When the estimated radio quality of the NR link is good, the uplink data transmission uses the SCG radio resources.
- When the estimated radio quality of the NR link is poor, the uplink data transmission uses the MCG radio resources.

To enable MCG and SCG radio resource switching in uplink, the

UlCgSwitchCfg.ulCgSwitchMode attribute must be set to

ENABLED in the serving NR cell.

The switching of MCG and SCG radio resources in uplink is slower than it is in downlink

because it involves the reconfiguration of the

UE.

The configuration of the

UlDataSplitUeCfg.initialUlPrimaryPathMode

attribute determines whether the MCG or the SCG radio resources of the Secondary

Node-terminated split DRB is used initially for user plane transmission in uplink.

When

the Service-Adaptive Uplink User Plane Profile feature is activated, different

configurations can be used for each 5QI, which can be configured with the

CUCP5qi.endcUlDataSplitRef and the

CUCP5qi.nrdcUlDataSplitRef attributes, for EN-DC and NR-DC,

respectively. The CUCP5qi.endcUlDataSplitRef attribute references a

UlDataSplit MO instance, which is the parent MO class of the

UlDataSplitUeCfg.initialUlPrimaryPathMode attribute. If the

Service-Adaptive Uplink User Plane Profile feature is deactivated, the following MO

instances are applied for all CUCP5qi MO instances for EN-DC and

NR-DC, respectively, instead of the referenced instances:

- UlDataSplit=Default\_endc
- UlDataSplit=Default\_nrdc

For more information, see Service-Adaptive Uplink User Plane

Profile.

The trigger values for switching uplink MCG and SCG radio resources are configurable.

The following attributes can be used to configure trigger values for switching between

uplink MCG and SCG radio resources:

- UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualThresh
- UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualHyst

The radio quality of the NR link is defined by the threshold value

configured

through the

UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualThresh attribute. If the NR radio quality

drops below the configured threshold value, the gNodeB switches to the MCG radio

resources. The maximum value of the uplink SINR is estimated at every PUSCH reception. A

filter smoothes the uplink SINR samples. The smoothing is needed to normalize the

reaction time to temporary changes of the SINR. The maximum uplink-normalized SINR value

is checked against the value of the attribute.

In Low-Band and Mid-Band, if the UE quickly moves out of the NR cell coverage, the

detection of CRC failures and discontinuous transmissions in uplink causes the gNodeB to switch to the MCG radio resources. This happens

regardless of the estimated radio quality of the NR link.

In High-Band, an uplink radio resource switch is triggered if radio quality drops below

the configured

threshold,

or based on the failure of decoding CSI reports. If too many consecutive CSI CRC

failures are detected, the switch to MCG radio resources is triggered. When the radio

link quality improves, the

switch

back to SCG radio resources is triggered.

In High-Band, it is possible to switch to the DFTS-OFDM waveform and to a single uplink

TX port while user plane data is transmitted using SCG radio resources. This way, uplink

TX port switching provides a suitable buffer before switching to transmitting user plane

data using MCG radio resources.

The quality of MCG radio resources is not evaluated before the uplink resource switching.

The good quality of MCG radio resources must be ensured by the mobility procedures

determined by

the Master

Node-terminated MCG DRBs. Different uplink channel quality conditions

use different uplink switching mechanisms if both layer switching and radio resource

switching are enabled.

### 3.4.4 EN-DC Band Combination Coordination in the Secondary Node

The EN-DC band combination coordination function is used to

set up carrier aggregation (CA) in the MCG and the SCG. The Master Node is always the

eNodeB, and the Secondary Node is the gNodeB. The band combination coordination is

triggered to add the SCG during the following EN-DC procedures:

- Secondary Node Addition
- Secondary Node Modification

EN-DC band combination coordination can be set to LTE\_PREFERRED or

NR\_PREFERRED in the Master Node. Selecting the

LTE\_PREFERRED option optimizes LTE CA first, and maximizes CA

throughput for LTE. The NR\_PREFERRED option optimizes NR CA first and

then LTE CA. The NR\_PREFERRED option maximizes CA throughput for NR and

it is the recommended configuration for EN-DC band combination coordination.

The gNodeB prevents intra-band EN-DC if the Master Node is set to NR-preferred and blocks

intra-band EN-DC. This prevents considering frequencies in the same or overlapping

operating bands for EN-DC band combination coordination. The blocking has the following

effects:

- PSCell is selected based on the candidates the eNodeB sends to the gNodeB.
- PSCell is selected so that it does not conflict with the PCell band.
- NR SCells are not considered for CA if in the same band as the PSCell or the PCell.

Frequency-consistency check to avoid collision is performed by the Secondary Node at the

following steps:

- Secondary Node Addition and initial NR SCell selection
- NR SCell reselection
- PSCell change (and optional NR SCell change)
- Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Modification

The gNodeB rejects the EN-DC band combination in case of intra-band frequency collision

if it is blocked by the Master Node and there are no more PSCell candidates.

1. The Secondary Node receives a list of the allowed EN-DC band combinations from the Master Node. The band combinations match the selected LTE CA part and the target NR PSCell band. This list aims to maximize LTE throughput first. If EN-DC band combination coordination is set to NR\_PREFERRED, the Secondary Node receives a list of all band combinations that are valid for EN-DC CA. Band combinations are listed in a descending order according to maximized LTE throughput.
2. The Secondary Node selects the band combination and the feature set that are appropriate to the network configuration and that can maximize aggregated downlink bandwidth. If the UE capabilities do not allow the Secondary Node to select any band combinations, the request form the Master Node is rejected. If EN-DC band combination coordination is set to NR\_PREFERRED, the Secondary Node chooses the first available combination that maximizes NR throughput.
3. The selected band combination and feature set are signaled back to the Master Node, which completes the UE configuration.

For more information on Band Combination Coordination, see Basic Intelligent

Connectivity.

## 3.5 EN-DC Procedures

### 3.5.1 Secondary Node Addition

The Secondary Node Addition procedure is used to establish a UE context at the Secondary

Node which, this way, provides SCG radio resources to the EN-DC-capable UE.

Downlink packet forwarding is supported in EN-DC during the

Secondary Node Addition procedure. It is always enabled and not controlled by MO

configuration. Downlink packets are forwarded from the Master Node to the Secondary Node

using the X2-U interface.

During the Secondary Node Addition procedure, the EN-DC band combination is chosen in the

Secondary Node in coordination with the allowed EN-DC band combinations signaled by the

Master Node. The EN-DC-capable UE is configured with the MCG and SCG information (LTE

and NR carriers) according to the chosen EN-DC band combination.

Figure 4   Secondary Node Addition Procedure

Secondary Node Addition is not performed if the following

conditions are met:

- The PSCell is barred or reserved for the operator.
- The UeMCCellProfile and the UeMCCellProfileUeCfg MO classes are configured to specify that cells that are barred or reserved for the operator are also blocked for UEs in RRC\_CONNECTED mode.

1. Secondary Node Addition Preparation
    1. Following the configuration-based or the B1 measurement-based triggering of the Secondary Node Addition procedure, the Master Node sends an X2AP SGNB ADDITION REQUEST message to the Secondary Node through the X2-C interface. The message contains the EN-DC band combinations and an NR target cell the Master Node selected. A timer supervising EN-DC procedures over the X2 interface starts when the Master Node sends the message.
    2. If the Secondary Node sends the X2AP SGNB ADDITION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to the Master Node, new allocated SCG radio resources exist on the Secondary Node, as well as MCG radio resources on the Master Node, for the UE. The timer supervising EN-DC procedures over the X2 interface stops when the Master Node receives the message. The Secondary Node chooses one of the band combinations provided by the Master Node, and selects one PSCell, and possibly also NR SCells. The Secondary Node then sends the selected band combination back in the SGNB ADDITION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message. The EN-DC configuration is finalized in the Master Node based on the selected band combination. Note: If the target PSCell is overloaded, the Secondary Node sends the X2AP SGNB ADDITION REQUEST REJECT message to the Master Node. After receiving this message, the Master Node includes the target PSCell in the NR cell denylist and excludes it from the Secondary Node Addition procedure. If the target PSCell is blocked for UEs in RRC\_CONNECTED mode, the Secondary Node sends the X2AP SGNB ADDITION REQUEST REJECT message to the Master Node with the cell-not-available or the target-not-allowed cause value. After receiving this message with the cell-not-available cause value, the Master Node includes the target PSCell in the NR cell denylist and excludes it from the Secondary Node Addition procedure.
    3. The Master Node sends the SN STATUS TRANSFER message to the Secondary Node. The SN STATUS TRANSFER message contains the PDCP status information (uplink and downlink COUNT values) for RLC AM bearers to be reconfigured from Master Node terminated to Secondary Node terminated DRBs.
    4. Separate LTE carrier aggregation thresholds are used for the split DRBs to control the activation and deactivation of LTE SCells. The following attributes are used to set the carrier aggregation thresholds on the Master Node: CarrierAggregationFunction.dcSCellActDeactDataThres CarrierAggregationFunction.dcSCellActDeactDataThresHyst CarrierAggregationFunction.dcSCellDeactDelayTimer
2. RRC Connection Reconfiguration
    1. The Master Node initiates the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message to the UE. The message includes the NR RRC configuration message the Master Node received from the Secondary Node.
    2. The UE applies the new configuration. LTE Random Access procedure between the UE and the Master Node is performed.
    3. The UE sends the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message to the Master Node. All the LTE SCells are activated once the RRC reconfiguration of the UE is completed to receive the data.
3. The Master Node sends the SGNB RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message to indicate to the Secondary Node that the UE is reconfigured successfully. The time to wait for the SGNB RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message is configured in the GNBCUCPFunction.tDcOverall attribute on the Secondary Node. Note: It is recommended that the value of the GNBCUCPFunction.tDcOverall timer in the Secondary Node be greater than the value of the Rrc.tRrcConnectionReconfiguration timer in the Master Node.
4. Path Update
    1. The Master Node starts updating the user plane path for the Secondary Node terminated split DRBs by sending the E-RAB MODIFICATION INDICATION message to the MME.
    2. The MME confirms the user plane path update by sending the E-RAB MODIFICATION CONFIRM message to the Master Node.
5. NR Random Access procedure between the UE and the Secondary Node is performed.

#### 3.5.1.1 Packet Forwarding at Secondary Node Addition

Downlink packet forwarding is supported in EN-DC during the

Secondary Node Addition procedure. It is always enabled and not controlled by MO

configuration. Downlink packets are forwarded from the Master Node to the Secondary Node

using the X2-U interface.

During the Secondary Node Addition procedure, bearer resources allowed to be Secondary

Node terminated Split DRBs are moved from the Master Node to the Secondary Node.

Downlink packets are sent from the SGW to old bearer resources in the Master Node. During

the Secondary Node Addition procedure, a packet forwarding tunnel between the two nodes

is established over the X2-U interface.

Packet forwarding behavior between the old and the new bearer resources varies based on

the following conditions:

- In both RLC AM and UM, downlink packets that are not yet sent to the UE by the old bearer resources in the Master Node are forwarded to the newly set up Split DRBs. The Split DRBs in the Secondary Node send these packets to the UE.
- In RLC AM, downlink packets from the Master Node that are sent to, but not acknowledged by the UE, are forwarded to the Secondary Node terminated Split DRB where they are dropped.

Packet forwarding between old and newly set up bearer resources ensures that packet loss

is minimized during the Secondary Node Addition procedure.

Packet forwarding ends when the path switch is completed and the SGW starts sending

packets to the new bearer resources in the Secondary Node.

Figure 6   Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Modification

1. Secondary Node Modification Preparation
    1. The Master Node triggers the modification procedure by sending the SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST message to the Secondary Node. A timer supervising EN-DC procedures over the X2 interface starts when the Master Node sends the message.
    2. The Secondary Node confirms the procedure by sending the SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message back. The timer supervising EN-DC procedures over the X2 interface stops when the Master Node receives one of the following messages: SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE SN STATUS TRANSFER if RLC AM Secondary Node-terminated DRBs are released SECONDARY RAT DATA USAGE REPORT if the function is activated in the Master Node Note: This message is only sent if Secondary Node-terminated DRBs are released, or at the SCG Release procedure.
2. RRC Connection Reconfiguration
    1. The Master Node initiates RRC connection reconfiguration towards the UE by sending the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, including the NR RRC reconfiguration message received from the Secondary Node, to it.
    2. The LTE Random Access procedure between the UE and the Master Node is only performed at either an SCG Addition or an SCG Release procedure.
    3. The UE applies the new configuration and replies to Master Node in the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message, including the NR RRC response message.
3. If requested by the Secondary Node, the Master Node sends the SGNB RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message to the Secondary Node indicating that the reconfiguration procedure by the UE is completed.
4. The NR Random Access procedure between the UE and the Secondary Node is only performed at SCG Addition.

### 3.5.3 Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Modification

The Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure is initiated by the

Secondary Node and has one of the following purposes:

| Uplink Resource Switching                     |    | The switching of the uplink MCG and SCG resources in the EN-DC-capable UE                             is performed between the Master Node and the Secondary Node, and RRC                             signaling between the UE and the Primary Node.                             The procedure                             to switch from MCG to SCG is the same as                             the                             one to switch from SCG to MCG in uplink.                             The Secondary Node Modification Request contains the                             NR RRC information indicating if the uplink resource switch is from MCG                             to SCG, or from SCG to MCG. Then the NR RRC information is sent to the                             UE,                             which sends the NR RRC response to                             be transmitted to the Secondary Node.   |

Figure 7   Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Modification

1. Secondary Node Modification Required The Secondary Node sends the SGNB MODIFICATION REQUIRED message to the primary Node requesting the reconfiguration of the UE. For high rate, the request includes the DRB downlink RLC timers that are set to the values defined by the DrbRlcUeCfg.tStatusProhibitDlHighRate and DrbRlcUeCfg.tReassemblyDlHighRate attributes.
2. RRC Connection Reconfiguration
    1. The Primary Node initiates the RRC connection reconfiguration to the UE by sending the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message containing the NR RRC information received from the Secondary Node.
    2. The UE applies the new configuration and replies to the Primary Node in the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message containing the NR RRC response to be relayed to the Secondary Node.
3. The Primary Node sends the SGNB MODIFICATION CONFIRM message to the Secondary Node to indicate that the reconfiguration of the UE is completed. This message contains the NR RRC response from the UE.

### 3.5.4 Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Release

The Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Release procedure is initiated by the Master

Node. It is used to trigger the release of the UE context at the Secondary Node.

Downlink packet forwarding is supported in EN-DC during the Secondary Node Release

procedure. It is always enabled and not controlled by MO configuration. Downlink packets

are forwarded from the Secondary Node to the Master Node using the X2-U interface.

During the Secondary Node Release procedure, all the

LTE SCells are configured simultaneously and activated based on LTE carrier

aggregation buffer thresholds.

Figure 8   Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Release

1. Secondary Node Release
    1. The Master Node triggers the release of the SCG resources for a specific UE by sending the SGNB RELEASE REQUEST message to the Secondary Node. A timer supervising EN-DC procedures over the X2 interface starts when the Master Node sends the message.
    2. The Secondary Node confirms the procedure by sending the SGNB RELEASE REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message back. The timer supervising EN-DC procedures over the X2 interface stops when the Master Node receives one of the following messages: SGNB RELEASE REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE SN STATUS TRANSFER if RLC AM Secondary Node terminated DRBs exist SECONDARY RAT DATA USAGE REPORT if the function is activated in the Master Node
    3. The Secondary Node sends a SN STATUS TRANSFER message containing PDCP status information (uplink and downlink COUNT values) for Secondary Node terminated DRBs in RLC AM to the Master Node.
2. RRC Connection Reconfiguration
    1. The Master Node initiates reconfiguration of the RRC connection to the UE in RRC\_CONNECTED mode. The reconfiguration is triggered by the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message.
    2. The LTE Random Access procedure between the UE and the Master Node is performed.
    3. The UE, applying the new configuration, sends the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message back to the Master Node.
3. Path Update (if the UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED mode)
    1. The Master Node starts updating the user plane path for the Master Node terminated MCG DRBs by sending the E-RAB MODIFICATION INDICATION message to the MME.
    2. The MME confirms the user plane path update by sending the E-RAB MODIFICATION CONFIRM message to the Master Node.
4. The Master Node triggers the procedure to release the UE context at the Secondary Node by sending the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message.

#### 3.5.4.1 Packet Forwarding at Secondary Node Release

During the Secondary Node Release procedure, bearer resources allowed to be Secondary

Node terminated Split DRBs are moved from the Secondary Node to the Master Node.

Downlink packets are sent from the SGW to the Secondary Node. If the bearer resources in

the Secondary Node are released, packet forwarding is performed from the Secondary Node

to the Master Node. A packet forwarding tunnel between the two nodes is established over

the X2-U interface.

Packet forwarding behavior between the bearer resources varies based on the following

conditions:

- In RLC UM, downlink packets that are not yet sent to the UE by the bearer resources in the Secondary Node are forwarded to the Master Node.
- In RLC AM, downlink packets from the Secondary Node that are sent to, but not acknowledged by the UE, are forwarded to the Master Node terminated Split DRB where they are dropped.

Packet forwarding between the bearer resources ensures that packet loss is minimized

during the Secondary Node Release procedure.

Packet forwarding ends when the SGW sends an end marker to the Secondary Node. The

Secondary Node Release procedure is completed.

### 3.5.5 Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Release

The Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Release procedure is initiated by the

Secondary Node. It is used to trigger the release of the UE context at the Secondary

Node.

During the Secondary Node Release procedure, all the

LTE SCells are configured simultaneously and activated based on LTE carrier

aggregation buffer thresholds.

Figure 10   Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Release

1. Secondary Node Release
    1. The Secondary Node triggers the release of the SCG resources for a specific UE by sending the SGNB RELEASE REQUIRED message to the Master Node.
    2. The Master Node confirms the procedure by sending the SGNB RELEASE CONFIRM message back. A timer supervising EN-DC procedures over the X2 interface starts only when the Master Node needs to wait for the reception of the following messages: The SN STATUS TRANSFER message if RLC AM Secondary Node terminated DRBs exist. The SECONDARY RAT DATA USAGE REPORT message if the function is activated in the Master Node.
    3. The Secondary Node sends a SN STATUS TRANSFER message containing PDCP status information (uplink and downlink COUNT values) for Secondary Node terminated DRBs in RLC AM to the Master Node.
2. RRC Connection Reconfiguration
    1. The Master Node initiates reconfiguration of the RRC connection to the UE in RRC\_CONNECTED mode. The reconfiguration is triggered by the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message.
    2. The LTE Random Access procedure between the UE and the Master Node is performed.
    3. The UE, applying the new configuration, sends the RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete message back to the Master Node.
3. Path Update (if the UE is in RRC\_CONNECTED mode)
    1. The Master Node starts updating the user plane path for the Master Node terminated MCG DRBs by sending the E-RAB MODIFICATION INDICATION message to the MME.
    2. The MME confirms the user plane path update by sending the E-RAB MODIFICATION CONFIRM message to the Master Node.
4. The Master Node triggers the procedure to release the UE context at the Secondary Node by sending the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message.

### 3.5.6 Secondary Node Indicating User Activity

The Secondary Node reports to the Master Node if the UE becomes inactive or reactivated.

Reporting is done on a UE level for all Secondary Node terminated DRBs combined.

Figure 11   Reporting User Activity

1. The Secondary Node sends an X2AP SGNB ACTIVITY NOTIFICATION message to the Master Node in the following cases: When no user plane data is sent to or received from the UE on any of the Secondary Node terminated DRBs for the amount of time configured through the InactivityProfileUeCfg.tInactivityTimerEndcSn attribute. When user plane data is sent to or received from the UE on any of the Secondary Node terminated DRBs after the inactivity notification. The X2AP SGNB ACTIVITY NOTIFICATION message indicates to the Master Node that the UE is inactive or reactivated considering Secondary Node terminated DRBs.

For more information on the UE group-based configuration of the inactivity timer, see

NR Service-Adaptive Inactivity Timer.

Other Network Elements

Some UEs cannot perform viable SINR measurements under certain conditions, for

example, when SINR measurements are performed on Low-Band or Mid-Band frequencies

and the PSCell of the UE is in a High-Band cell. This might result in the

degradation of the following KPIs in EN-DC deployments:

- SCG Active Radio Resource Retainability considering EN-DC connectivity, Captured in gNodeB
- EN-DC inter-sgNodeB PSCell Change success rate captured in gNodeB
- EN-DC intra-sgNodeB PSCell Change success rate captured in gNodeB
- EN-DC Setup Success Rate Captured in gNodeB

This KPI degradation can be mitigated by applying a different Mobility Control

at Poor Coverage function configuration for UEs that have SINR measurement problems.

For such UEs, a configuration that does not rely on any SINR measurements is

recommended, which can be achieved by using the UE Grouping Framework. For more

information, see the Handling UEs with Hard Limitations section in UE Grouping Framework.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for LTE-NR Dual Connectivity

## 8.1 Configure IP Connectivity for the X2-U Interface on the Secondary Node in EN-DC

In EN-DC, the user plane connection between the Master Node (eNodeB) and the Secondary Node (gNodeB) is established over the X2-U interface.

It is recommended to use optical 10G connection for all routers between the nodes in EN-DC, if the LTE air interface capacity is above 600Mbps across all cells in the eNodeB.

Prerequisites

A LocalIpEndpoint MO that can be used to refer to X2 must exist on

the gNodeB. If it doesn't exist, create an instance of

it.

Steps

1. Add X2 to the LocalIpEndpoint.interfaceList list.

Results

The IP address for EN-DC connectivity over the X2-U interface is configured on the

gNodeB.

For more information on direct X2 IPsec configuration for the gNodeB in EN-DC, see Manage IPsec.

After This Task

The gNodeB needs to be restarted, so that the configured IP

address for the X2-U interface can be applied. After node restart, the

TermPointToENodeB.administrativeState attribute, as well as

the termination point on the eNodeB, must be

UNLOCKED to initiate the X2 Setup procedure.

For more information about X2 Setup procedure, see X2 Configuration.

## 8.2 X2 Link Break

X2 link break in EN-DC occurs when the connection over the X2 interface is lost between

the Master Node (eNodeB) and the Secondary Node (gNodeB).

An X2 link break is typically caused by the following:

- The TermPointToENodeB MO on the Secondary Node to the Master Node is locked
- The termination point on the Master Node to the Secondary Node is locked
- Transport failure
- The Master Node restarts or is not operational

An X2 link break in EN-DC is detected in the Master Node and the Secondary Node

independently. The Secondary Node can lose connection to all Master Nodes over the X2

interface in EN-DC, and in such cases, the LTE Anchor Service

Unavailable alarm is raised on the Secondary Node. The alarm is

ceased if at least one of the following conditions is met:

- Connection to at least one Master Node is restored.
- All connections are manually locked on the Secondary Node side.
- All TermPointToENodeB MOs are deleted as described in Removal of TermPointToENodeB MO in X2 Configuration.

The Secondary Node releases all the resources associated with the

affected X2 link.

It is recommended to use optical 10G connection for all routers between the gNodeB and eNodeB in EN-DC if the LTE

air interface capacity is above 600 Mbps across all cells in the eNodeB.

X2AP partial reset support in EN-DC deployment allows the release of only

some of the UE using the X2 link. On a high-level, the process consists of the following

steps:

1. The Secondary Node sends the PARTIAL RESET REQUIRED message to the Master Node.
2. The Master Node responds with the PARTIAL RESET CONFIRM message.
3. All resources used by the UE indicated in the PARTIAL RESET REQUIRED message are released. To trigger the release, the same procedure is used as in the case of an X2 link break. The following messages are sent by the Master Node: S1 RESET to the MME RRCConnectionRelease is sent to the affected UE.

.

## 8.3 TCP Optimization for Secondary Node Terminated DRBs in EN-DC

TCP optimization is available for Secondary Node terminated split and MCG DRBs in EN-DC.

With TCP optimization, queuing delay is reduced in the downlink user plane traffic,

resulting in improved end user performance.

For TCP optimization of the Secondary Node terminated DRBs, the Active Queue Management

(AQM) is primarily active in the PDCP SDU queue and is partially available also in the

Radio Link Control (RLC) SDU queue in the gNodeB. The AQM is

applied for each bearer and only to downlink user traffic in EN-DC.

The

AQM mode in the PDCP SDU queue is set through the AqmCfg.aqmMode

attribute under the GNBCUUPFunction MO class, and can have one of the

following values:

## 8.4 Secondary RAT Data Usage Reporting

The secondary RAT data usage reporting functionality provides UE-level

observability information in EN-DC. This information is available in the EPC about the

data volume transmitted by the SCG radio resources of a Secondary Node terminated split

DRB.

UE-level data volume information is gained from

the Secondary Node through dedicated

signaling over the following interfaces:

- The X2 interface between the Master Node (eNodeB) and the Secondary Node (gNodeB).
- The S1 interface between both the Master and Secondary Nodes and the MME.

Data usage reports are generated at the following EN-DC procedures:

- SCG Release (Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Modification)
- Secondary Node Release (both Master Node and Secondary Node initiated)
- E-RAB Release of a Secondary Node terminated split DRB

The signaling and report formats are standardized by 3GPP. The reports contain the

following information:

- The time period covered by the report.
- The uplink data volume information for a set of Secondary Node terminated split DRBs.
- The downlink data volume information for a set of Secondary Node terminated split DRBs.

The secondary RAT data usage reporting functionality is

activated on the Secondary Node by setting the

GNBCUUPFunction.endcDataUsageReportEnabled attribute to

true. If the secondary RAT data usage reporting is activated on the

Master Node, the Secondary Node signals the data usage report to the EPC.

## 8.5 Configure Ciphering Algorithm Priority for Secondary Node Terminated DRBs

Secondary Node terminated DRBs are ciphered and deciphered in the Secondary Node. The

ciphering algorithm is selected independently.

Steps

1. Configure the SecurityHandling.cipheringAlgoPrio attribute to set the priority order in which the ciphering algorithm is selected.

## 8.6 Configure Radio Link Failure Parameters for the Secondary Cell Group

In EN-DC, Radio Link Control (RLC) and Radio Resource Control (RRC) parameters exist

for SCG radio configuration. By using these parameters, the Radio Link Failure (RLF)

conditions can be set for the SCG resources available for the UE. The RLF conditions

configured using these parameters are signaled to the UE in the

RRCConnectionReconfiguration NR RRC message. If the UE detects

RLF, which means RLC or RRC parameter values are exceeded, it sends the

SCGFailureInformationNR LTE RRC message to the Master Node. The

purpose of the message is to indicate a failure of the SCG resources to the Master

Node.

At the reception of the SCGFailureInformationNR message, the Master

Node initiates the Secondary Node Release procedure.

Steps

1. Set the Rrc.t310 attribute to configure a waiting time for RLF. By configuring a waiting time for RLF, the trigger to the UE sending the SCGFailureInformationNR message can be modified.
2. Set the Rrc.t304 attribute to configure a waiting time for the completion of a successful NR Random Access procedure. When the timer for a successful NR Random Access procedure expires, the UE detects RLF and sends the SCGFailureInformationNR message to the Master Node.
3. Configure the DrbRlcUeCfg.dlMaxRetxThreshold attribute to define the number of the maximum allowed RLC retransmission in downlink. When this number is reached, the Secondary Node detects RLF and initiates the Secondary Node Release procedure.
4. Configure the DrbRlcUeCfg.ulMaxRetxThreshold attribute to define the number of the maximum allowed RLC retransmission in uplink. When this number is reached, the UE sends the SCGFailureInformationNR message to the Master Node which initiates the Secondary Node Release procedure.
5. Configure the DrbRlcUeCfg.tPollRetransmitDl attribute to set the time when a new poll request is sent by the UE. This occurs if no RLC status report is received from the Secondary Node. When the average ARQ RTT measured by the gNodeB is greater than the MO setting, the measured value is used and configured to the UE instead of the value in the t-PollRetransmit IE. This IE is only configurable at bearer setup. Configured bearers cannot be reconfigured.
6. Configure the DrbRlcUeCfg.tPollRetransmitUl attribute to set the time when a new poll request is sent by the Secondary Node. This occurs if no RLC status report is received from the UE. When the average ARQ RTT measured by the gNodeB is greater than the MO setting, the measured value is used and configured to the UE instead of the value in the t-PollRetransmit IE. This IE is only configurable at bearer setup. Configured bearers cannot be reconfigured.

## 8.7 Configure Initial Uplink User Plane Transmission for the Secondary Node in EN-DC

The

UlDataSplitUeCfg.initialUlPrimaryPathMode

attribute settings determine whether the MCG or the SCG radio resources of the

Secondary Node terminated split DRB is used initially for user plane transmission in

uplink.

Steps

1. Set the UlDataSplitUeCfg.initialUlPrimaryPathMode attribute to either of the following values depending on the required radio resource of the Secondary Node terminated split DRB for initial uplink user plane transmission: Option Description MCG The MCG radio resources of the Secondary Node terminated split DRB are used for initial uplink user plane transmission. SCG The SCG radio resources of the Secondary Node terminated split DRB are used for initial uplink user plane transmission.

## 8.8 Configure Threshold Value for Uplink Resource Switching

A lower value of the

UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualThresh

attribute allows greater NR usage, while a higher value allows the maximization of

NR throughput.

The values of the

UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualThresh

and the

UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualHyst

attributes are recommended configurations. For more information on the possible

value ranges, see the MOM description.

The following EBS counters provide observability for the switching of uplink MCG and

SCG radio resources of the

Secondary

Node-terminated

split DRB:

- The pmEbsEndcPrimaryCgSwitchUlMcgTrigger$ EBS counter increases when the estimated radio quality of the NR link on SCG is poor.
- The pmEbsEndcPrimaryCgSwitchUlScgTrigger$ EBS counter increases when the estimated radio quality of the NR Link on SCG is good.

It is recommended to configure the

UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualThresh

attribute to a value that is high enough to enable switching to the MCG radio

resources before the uplink SCG throughput becomes lower than the required uplink

throughput.

Prerequisites

The

UlCgSwitchCfg.ulCgSwitchMode

attribute is set to ENABLED in the serving NR cell.

Steps

1. Set the value of the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to LOCKED.
2. Set the value of the UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualThresh attribute to the following values: Band Recommended Value Range Low-Band and Mid-Band -2-40 dB(1) High-Band 17(2) (1) The 35-40 dB value range is only recommended for high throughput scenarios. (2) In poor radio conditions in High-Band, a slight decrease in the NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalMenb and the NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalSgnb PM counters are expected. The decrease is more likely if the value of the UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualThresh attribute is set below the recommended levels.
3. Set the value of the UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualHyst attribute to the following values: Band Recommended Value Range Low-Band and Mid-Band 6-12 dB High-Band 6 dB

It is recommended to set

the

value of

the

UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualHyst

attribute to at least 6 dB to minimize the switching of uplink

radio resources.

4. Set the value of the NRCellDU.administrativeState attribute to UNLOCKED.

## 8.9 High Power UE Support in NR Configuration in EN-DC

The High Power

UE Support in NR function supports power class 2 (26 dBm) and power class 1.5 (29 dBm).

UEs with a maximum power value that is higher than the default power class (23 dBm).

This way, it increases uplink coverage and uplink edge throughput. The function is

supported in NR FR1 TDD.

The function allows a

maximum of power class 1.5 of transmission power for high power UEs. The PCell band must support the

high power UE for the function to be operable.

The function is applicable for the following configurations:

- Inter-band EN-DC FDD-TDD with power class 2 in FR1
- Inter-band EN-DC TDD-TDD with power class 2 in FR1
- Intra-band EN-DC with power class 2 in FR1

To activate this function, one of the following

requirements must be fulfilled on the gNodeB:

- The NRCellDU.pMax attribute is set to a value higher than 23.
- The NRCellDU.pMax attribute is not configured or it is set to 1000.

## 8.10 Configure ASGH-Based B1 Measurement Threshold for EN-DC

When configuring B1 threshold for EN-DC, to avoid triggering critical coverage for NR,

the B1 threshold must be set higher in the eNodeB than the A2 threshold set in the

gNodeB.

## 8.11 Configure UE Capability Enquiry

The configuration supports the exchange of the UE capability information in one, two,

or three messages between the UE and the eNodeB.

Prerequisites

The RRC UE Capability Enquiry message can be configured for

EN-DC-capable or NR standalone-capable UEs, or for UEs capable of both deployment

types.

Steps

1. Set the ENodeBFunction.ueCapabilityEnquirySteps attribute to one of the following values: ONE\_STEP The eNodeB sends one RRC UE Capability Enquiry message to the UE. The RAT-Type IE can contain the EUTRA, NR, and EUTRA\_NR values, see Table 9 for the details. The UE replies with one RRC UE Capability Information message containing the information for all three RAT types.Note: In case of the Initial Attach procedure, the eNodeB sends the RRC UE Capability Enquiry message in two messages even if the ONE\_STEP value is configured. TWO\_STEP The eNodeB sends two consecutive RRC UE Capability Enquiry messages to the UE. In the first message, the RAT-Type IE contains the EUTRA value. In the second message, the RAT-Type IE can contain the EUTRA\_NR and NR values. If the UE is only NR standalone capable, only NR is requested. The UE replies with two RRC UE Capability Information messages respectively. THREE\_STEP The eNodeB sends three parallel RRC UE Capability Enquiry messages to the UE. In each message, the RAT-Type IE contains a request for a different value. The three values requested separately are EUTRA , EUTRA\_NR, and NR. If the UE is only NR standalone capable, only NR is requested. The UE replies with two or three RRC UE Capability Information messages respectively.Note: In case of the Initial Attach procedure, the eNodeB sends the RRC UE Capability Enquiry message only for the EUTRA\_NR and the NR RAT-Type values in parallel messages. When the LTE Uplink RRC Message Segmentation feature is introduced, each UECapabilityEnquiry message includes an rrc-SegAllowed-r16 IE. The rrc-SegAllowed-r16 IE informs the UEs that the UECapabilityInformation can be sent in segments.Note: When setting up initial connection, the eNodeB does not know if a UE supports the LTE Uplink RRC Message Segmentation feature. Therefore, the eNodeB always includes rrc-SegAllowed-r16 IEs in the UECapabilityInformation messages when the LTE Uplink RRC Message Segmentation feature is introduced.

### 8.11.1 RRC UE Capability Enquiry Based on UE Capabilities and Feature Activation

The RRC UE Capability Enquiry message for EUTRA\_NR

and NR capabilities is configured based on UE capabilities, taking

into consideration whether the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature and the following

EN-DC-related features are activated:

- Basic Intelligent Connectivity
- Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control
- EN-DC-Triggered Handover during Setup
- EN-DC-Triggered Handover during Connected Mode Mobility

## 8.12 Recommendation for the PSCell-Specific B1 Threshold Offset Configuration for EN-DC Setup

If PSCell-specific B1 threshold offsets are set for EN-DC setup, it is recommended to

check the configured cell individual offset values for intra-frequency PSCell Change to

ensure that they are aligned with the B1 threshold-specific offset. If necessary, cell

individual offset values for PSCell change can be adjusted through the

NRCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetNR attribute for the

intra-frequency neighbor relations in the Secondary Node.

## 8.13 Configuration Options Related to NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile

The NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile feature introduces support for UE

group-differentiated user plane configuration and enhancements for downlink cell group

switching and AQM.

The NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile introduces and deprecates attributes, which

affect this feature.

For more information, see NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile.

### 8.13.1 Deprecation Handling

The following attributes are introduced for deprecation handling:

- GNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled
- GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled
- GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled

The GNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled and the

GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled attributes control

whether the legacy or the updated MOM configuration is used.

If the following attributes are set to false, legacy attributes are used

with deprecation handling:

- GNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled
- GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled

If the following attributes are set to true, the introduced MOM

configuration is used:

- GNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled
- GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled

Node restart is required after both changes.

Backwards Compatible Changes

For backwards compatibility, the

GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled attribute is used and

by default it is set to true.

All deprecated attribute values are copied from the NRCellDU MO

instances to the replacement attributes in the CgSwitchCfg MO

instances.

When normal deprecation handling is enabled, the MO instance of the introduced MO

class corresponding to the NRCellDU MO instance is automatically

deleted or created.

When normal deprecation handling is enabled, and the operator creates an

NRCellDU MO instance, instances of the following MO classes

must not be created manually:

- CgSwitch
- CgSwitchCfg
- CgSwitchUeCfg
- UeCC

If the operator wants to create instances of these MO classes together with

NRCellDU MO instances in the same transaction, the creation

of the NRCellDU MO instance must be ordered after the creation of

the listed MO classes.

Normal deprecation handling only works for NRCellDU MO instances

that are mapped to one CgSwitch MO instance, and if the number of

CgSwitch MO instances is at most 48. When an

NRCellDU MO instance is created, but there is no

CgSwitch MO instance left, deprecation handling is not

applied for that cell. Therefore, default values are used instead for the following

attributes:

- NRCellDU.endcDlLegSwitchEnabled
- NRCellDU.endcDlNrLowQualThresh
- NRCellDU.endcDlNrQualHyst

It is possible to control which configuration to use for each

NRCellDU instance by setting the

GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled attribute to

false, even when more than 48 NRCellDU MO

instances are created. There is still a limitation of having 48 plus one

CgSwitch MO instances for configuration. Additionally, UE

grouping is only supported when the

GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled attribute is set to

false.

Figure 12 shows normal deprecation

handling.

Figure 12   Normal Deprecation Handling

It is recommended to configure the user plane attributes in the

CgSwitchCfg MO class if the class is available in the

Management System.

It is recommended to update the attribute values in the introduced MO classes first,

when deprecation handling is disabled and the

GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled attribute is set to

false.

Disabling deprecation handling prevents attributes in the

CgSwitchCfg MO instance from being overwritten in the

introduced management system versions. In these use cases, the

CgSwitchCfg MO instance is visible and used instead of the

deprecated attributes.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes

Changes in the following MO classes are non-backwards compatible because of the

reduced cardinality of the introduced MO classes:

- AqmCfg
- DcDlCfg
- Drb
- DrbUeCfg
- UserPlaneProfile
- UserPlaneProfileUeCfg

Therefore, it is recommended to configure the user plane attributes in these MO

classes if they are available in the Management System.

If the change to the introduced MO classes and attributes is not performed before the

deprecation window ends, default values are applied if no configuration is

provided.

Figure 13 and Figure 14 show alternative deprecation

handling, when the altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled attribute is set

to true.

Figure 13   Alternative Deprecation Handling in

GNBCUUPFunction

Figure 14   Alternative Deprecation Handling in

GNBDUFunction

It is recommended to migrate as soon as possible to the introduced attributes to

fully realize the benefits of the new configuration management for this feature, and

avoid using the following attributes:

- CUUP5qi.aqmMode
- CUUP5qi.dcDlPdcpAggrPrioCg
- CUUP5qi.dcDlPdcpAggrTimeDiffCg
- CUUP5qi.dcDlPdcpAggrTimeDiffProhibit
- CUUP5qi.dcDlPdcpAggrTimeDiffThresh
- CUUP5qi.estimatedE2ERTT
- CUUP5qi.l4sCfgRef
- CUUP5qi.packetDelayBudget
- CUUP5qi.packetDelayBudgetOffset
- CUUP5qi.tOooUlDelivery
- DU5qi.aqmMode
- DU5qi.estimatedE2ERTT
- DU5qi.packetDelayBudgetOffset
- GNBCUUPFunction.dcDlAggActTime
- GNBCUUPFunction.dcDlAggExpiryTimer
- GNBCUUPFunction.dcDlPdcpInitialMcgRate
- GNBCUUPFunction.dcDlPdcpInitialScgRate
- GNBCUUPFunction.dlPdcpSpsTargetTimeLTE
- GNBCUUPFunction.dlPdcpSpsTargetTimeNR
- GNBCUUPFunction.endcDlNrRetProhibTimer

### 8.13.2 Migration Information

The NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile feature introduces attributes and MO

classes for UE group-differentiated user plane configuration, for downlink cell group

switching, and for AQM.

MO classes and attributes are introduced under the GNBCUUPFunction and

the GNBDUFunction MO classes to support the introduced

functionalities. These classes and attributes co-exist with deprecated attributes.

Therefore, the migration to the introduced attributes is recommended.

Guidelines for Migration from the GNBCUUPFunction MO Class to

the UserPlaneProfile MO Class

The migration described in this section does not use the UE Grouping Framework and

does not create UE-specific configuration.

The following rules must be considered:

- There is a single instance of the UserPlaneProfile MO class.
- The attribute values defined under the UserPlaneProfileUeCfg=Base MO instance are applied to all 5QIs and QCIs.

GNBCUUPFunction MO Class

Guidelines for Migration from the CUUP5qi MO Class to the

Drb and the UserPlaneProfile MO

Classes

The migration described in this section does not use the UE Grouping Framework and

does not create UE-specific configuration.

The following rules must be considered:

- The CUUP5qi.drbRef attribute must reference a Drb MO instance.
- The DrbUeCfg=Base MO instance must reference an AqmCfg MO instance and a DcDlCfg MO instance.
- Two or more CUUP5qi MO instances with the same attribute values can reference a single Drb MO instance. This results in the same AqmCfg and DcDlCfg MO instances being used for such CUUP5qi MO instances.
- Different Drb instances with a child DrbUeCfg=Base MO instance are needed for different AQM and PDCP settings. This results in different AqmCfg and DcDlCfg MO instances.
- Automatically created Drb MO instances can be referenced by any CUUP5qi MO instance.
- Automatically created instances of the following MO classes can be referenced by a Drb MO instance that is referenced by any CUUP5qi MO instance: AqmCfg DcDlCfg DrbUeCfg
- Manually created instances of L4sCfg MO class can be referenced by a Drb MO instance that is referenced by any CUUP5qi instance.

Guidelines for Migration from the DU5qi MO Class to the

DrbUp MO Class

The migration described in this section does not use the UE Grouping Framework and

does not create UE-specific configuration.

The following rules must be considered:

- The DU5qi.drbUpRef attribute must reference a DrbUp MO instance.
- The DrbUpUeCfg=Base MO instance must reference an AqmCfg MO instance.
- Two or more DU5qi MO instances with the same attribute values can reference a single DrbUp MO instance. This results in the same AqmCfg MO instance being used for any DU5qi MO instances.
- Different DrbUp MO instances with a child DrbUpUeCfg=Base MO instance are needed for different AQM settings. Different AqmCfg MO instances are needed.
- Automatically created instances of the following MO classes can be referenced by any DU5qi MO instance: AqmCfg DrbUp DrbUpUeCfg

## 8.14 Deprecation Handling

Deprecation handling is enabled by default.

The following backward compatible attributes are introduced to replace deprecated

attributes:

- The UlCgSwitchCfg.ulCgSwitchMode attribute replaces the NRCellDU.endcUlLegSwitchEnabled attribute.
- The UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualThresh attribute replaces the NRCellDU.endcUlNrLowQualThresh attribute.
- The UlCgSwitchCfg.ulScgLowQualHyst attribute replaces the NRCellDU.endcUlNrQualHyst attribute.
- The UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.ulPdcpScgRetProhibitTime attribute replaces the GNBCUUPFunction.endcUlNrRetProhibTimer attribute.
- The UlDataSplitUeCfg.initialUlPrimaryPathMode attribute replaces the QciProfileEndcConfigExt.initialUplinkConf attribute.
- The UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshScg attribute replaces the QciProfileEndcConfigExt.ulDataSplitThreshold attribute.
- The UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshMcg attribute replaces the QciProfileEndcConfigExt.ulDataSplitThresholdMcg attribute.

The following attributes control deprecation handling:

- GNBCUCPFunction.servAapUPProfUlDepHEnabled
- GNBCUUPFunction.servAdapUPProfUlDepHEnabled
- GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfUlDepHEnabled

The default value of

the

attributes are

true, which means that deprecation

handling is enabled by default to support the automatic migration of the attributes. All

deprecated attribute values are copied from

the corresponding

attributes under the NRCellDU MO class to the

replacement attributes under the UlCgSwitchCfg MO

instances.

Figure 15   Deprecation Handling

If deprecation handling is enabled, the instance of the introduced MO class that

corresponds

to the NRCellDU MO instance is automatically deleted or created.

If deprecation handling is enabled, and the operator creates an

NRCellDU MO instance, instances of the following MO classes must

not be created manually:

- UlCgSwitch
- UlCgSwitchCfg
- UlCgSwitchUeCfg
- UeCC

To create instances of

the

MO classes together with NRCellDU MO instances in the same

transaction, the creation of the NRCellDU MO instance must be ordered

after the creation of the listed MO classes.

UE grouping is supported only if

the

value of the GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfUlDepHEnabled attribute is

set to false.

It is recommended to configure the user plane attributes

under

the UlCgSwitchCfg MO class if the class is available in the

Management System.

It is recommended to update the attribute values in the introduced MO classes first, when

deprecation handling is disabled and

the

value of the GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfUlDepHEnabled attribute is

set to false.

Disabling deprecation handling prevents attributes under the

UlCgSwitchCfg MO instance from being overwritten in the

introduced

Management

System versions. In these use cases, the

UlCgSwitchCfg MO instance is visible and used instead of the

deprecated attributes.

A migration script is provided to support an optional automated migration to the

introduced MOM structure of the Service-Adaptive Uplink User Plane Profile feature. The

migration script is a complement to the deprecation handling mechanism that handles the

deprecated attributes

under

the NRCellDU MO class.

## 8.15 Uplink Traffic Distribution between the MCG and the SCG

The traffic distribution between the MCG and the SCG can be adjusted.

The preference of throughput over latency can be tuned in EN-DC and NR-DC deployments

independently by adjusting the

low

quality threshold of uplink cell group

switching

through the UlCgSwitchCfg.ulSCGLowQualThresh

attribute. This configuration can be used when a High-Band cell group still provides

high throughput, but the latency suffers from fluctuations because of the poor uplink

quality.

The throughput can also be tuned in EN-DC and NR-DC deployments independently by

adjusting the low-quality threshold of uplink cell group switching through the

UlCgSwitchCfg.ulSCGLowQualThresh attribute. This allows delayed

cell group switching to the MCG for deployments where the MCG has lower capacity.

## 8.16 Deprecation Handling Related to Service-Adaptive Uplink User Plane Profile

The

differentiated configuration thresholds for uplink cell group switching can be configured

with the backward compatible attributes.

The Service-Adaptive Uplink User Plane Profile feature introduces differentiated

configuration thresholds for uplink cell group switching for EN-DC and NR-DC. This

feature introduces and deprecates attributes, which

affect

the LTE-NR Dual Connectivity feature.

For more information, see Service-Adaptive Uplink User Plane Profile.

The following backward compatible attributes are introduced to replace the deprecated

attributes:

- The UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.ulPdcpScgRetProhibitTime attribute replaces the GNBCUUPFunction.endcUlNrRetProhibTimer attribute.
- The UlDataSplitUeCfg.initialUlPrimaryPathMode attribute replaces the QciProfileEndcConfigExt.initialUplinkConf attribute.
- The UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshScg attribute replaces the QciProfileEndcConfigExt.ulDataSplitThreshold attribute.
- The UlDataSplitUeCfg.ulDataSplitThreshMcg attribute replaces the QciProfileEndcConfigExt.ulDataSplitThresholdMcg attribute.

The following attributes control deprecation handling:

- GNBCUCPFunction.servAdapUPProfUlDepHEnabled
- GNBCUUPFunction.servAdapUPProfUlDepHEnabled

The default value of these attributes is true, which means that

deprecation handling is enabled by default to support the automatic migration of the

attributes.

# Appendix A: Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## Appendix A.a: 19.Q2: X2 IP Addressing for the gNodeB In EN-DC

X2-U connectivity attributes on the gNodeB can be configured

for EN-DC between the Master eNodeB and the Secondary gNodeB.

| Feature Name:           | LTE-NR Dual Connectivity        |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4908 R2                 |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Common Features Base Package |

| Access Type:            | NR                              |

The IP address for connections over the X2-U interface in EN-DC can be configured between

the Master eNodeB and the Secondary gNodeB using the

GNBCUUPFunction.x2UpIpAddressRef attribute.

If the GNBCUUPFunction.x2UpIpAddressRef attribute is not configured,

the GNBCUUPFunction.upIpAddressRef mandatory attribute can be used to

set up connections over the X2-U interface in EN-DC. These attributes are used for all

connections over the X2-U interface for the gNodeB.

## Appendix A.b: 19.Q3: Downlink Packet Forwarding at Secondary Node Addition Procedure for NR in EN-DC

Downlink packet forwarding is supported

between the Master Node and the Secondary Node during the Secondary Node Addition

procedure.

| Feature Name:           | LTE-NR Dual Connectivity        |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4908                    |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Common Features Base Package |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node             |
| Access Type:            | NR                              |

Downlink packet forwarding is supported in EN-DC during the Secondary Node Addition

procedure. It is always enabled and not controlled by MO configuration. Downlink

packets are forwarded from the Master Node to the Secondary Node using the X2-U

interface.

During the Secondary Node Addition procedure, bearer resources allowed to be

Secondary Node terminated Split DRBs are moved from the Master Node to the Secondary

Node. Packet forwarding is performed between old MCG bearers in the Master Node and

newly set up Split DRBs in the Secondary Node.

Packet forwarding ensures that downlink packet loss is minimized during the Secondary

Node Addition procedure.

If the new bearer resources are set up in the Secondary Node, user plane data in

downlink is sent to the new Secondary Node terminated Split DRBs.

Capacity and Performance

By ensuring that downlink packet loss is minimized during the Secondary Node Addition

procedure, data retransmission and TCP slow start can be avoided.

Operation

The following PM counters on the Secondary (gNodeB

include forwarded packet count in downlink for each QCI during the Secondary Node

Addition procedure:

- X2UTermination.pmPdcpPktFwdRecDlQos for received DRB packets
- X2UTermination.pmPdcpPktFwdRecDlDiscQos for discarded DRB packets

The following flexible counters on the Master (eNodeB

include forwarded packet count in EN-DC during the Secondary Node Addition procedure:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmFlexPdcpPktFwdDl
- EUtranCellFDD.pmFlexPdcpPktDiscDlHo
- EUtranCellTDD.pmFlexPdcpPktFwdDl
- EUtranCellTDD.pmFlexPdcpPktDiscDlHo

The following PM counters on the Master (eNodeB include

forwarded packet count in EN-DC during the Secondary Node Addition procedure:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpPktFwdDl
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpPktDiscDlHo
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpPktDiscDlHoQci
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcpPktFwdDl
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcpPktDiscDlHo
- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcpPktDiscDlHoQci

In EN-DC, the Master Node (eNodeB) manages the connection

between itself and the Secondary Node (gNodeB) over the X2

interface. At an X2 link break, the Master Node initiates connection re-establishment by

starting the X2 Setup procedure to the Secondary Node.

The LTE Anchor Service Unavailable alarm provides

information about the Master Nodes to which the connection is lost. The following

information is shown in the Additional Information field of

the alarm:

- The PLMNs associated with the Master Nodes to which the connection is lost.
- The identities of the Master Nodes to which the connection is lost.

The LTE Anchor Service Unavailable alarm ceases if the X2

connection between at least one Master Node and the Secondary Node is re-established. If

the X2 connection to at least one Master Node is re-established, the

TermPointToENodeB MO instance to that Master Node has the

following attribute values:

- The TermPointToENodeB.administrativeState attribute is UNLOCKED.
- The TermPointToENodeB.operationalState attribute is ENABLED.

The system automatically deletes instances of the

TermPointToENodeB MO which have the

TermPointToENodeB.operationalState attribute set to

DISABLED for 24 hours.

The Secondary Node can provide SCG resources to the EN-DC-capable UE if the connection

over the X2 interface is re-established between the Secondary Node and at least one of

the Master Nodes.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

LTE Anchor Service Unavailable is a new alarm raised on

the Secondary Node (gNodeB) when it loses connection to all

the Master Nodes (eNodeB) over the X2 interface in EN-DC.

The alarm is raised on a node level, on the GNBCUCPFunction

MO.

## Appendix A.d: 19.Q4: Improved PDCP Flow Control Feedback and Buffer Management

This enhancement updates the PDCP flow control algorithm to use transmitted feedback

instead of delivered feedback.

| Feature Name:           | LTE-NR Dual Connectivity                |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4908                            |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package                         |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002/5H R3  FAJ 801 4002/5LM R3 |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                     |
| Access Type:            | NR                                      |

With this enhancement, PDCP flow control with LTE-NR downlink aggregation is performed

based on feedback from eNodeB and gNodeB lower layers. This is related to PDCP SN

submitted to the MAC layer for transmission, rather than on feedback related to PDCP SN

acknowledged as correctly received by the UE.

The enhancement reduces the buffer latency variations in eNodeB and gNodeB when PDCP flow

control with LTE-NR downlink aggregation is performed. This functionality is applicable

to both UM and AM bearers.

AQM minimum packet age has the following characteristics:

- The functionality for AQM minimum age packet discard is moved from RLC to PDCP (CUUP) for EN-DC bearers.
- For SA bearers in gNodeB embedded deployments, AQM minimum packet age still runs in RLC.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The default value for the following two MOM parameters in MO

gNBCuupFunction is changed from 50 ms to 25 ms:

- dlPdcpSpsTargetTimeLTE
- dlPdcpSpsTargetTimeNR

The new KPI DL Packet Loss Captured in gNodeB is introduced.

Interfaces

This change affects the following interface:

- X2-U

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

To benefit from the change, the node must be upgraded to ENM version 19.3 to get the

new KPI in the KPI report.

## Appendix A.e: 19.Q4: Switching of Uplink MCG and SCG Resources

This enhancement enables the LTE-NR Dual Connectivity feature to use uplink switching

of MCG and SCG radio resources depending on the radio quality.

The switching of MCG and SCG radio resources allows uplink data transmission to use the

SCG radio resources when the estimated radio quality is good, and the MCG radio

resources when radio quality is poor. The switching of uplink MCG and SCG resources can

be used even with fast changing radio conditions.

If the NR radio quality drops below the threshold value, the UE switches to the MCG

resources of the split bearer.

Capacity and Performance

If there is poor radio quality on the SCG resources, uplink transmission performance

is preserved by switching to the MCG resources.

For the X2AP interface, the following messages are implemented:

- SGNB MODIFICATION REQUIRED
- SGNB MODIFICATION CONFIRM
- SGNB MODIFICATION REFUSE

Operation

The switching of uplink MCG and SCG resources is enabled on cell level by configuring

the NRCellDU.endcUlLegSwitchEnabled attribute. The

NRCellDU.endcUlNrLowQualThresh threshold value is configured

to define the threshold of low NR radio quality. The

NRCellDU.endcUlNrQualHyst parameter defines the hysteresis

for switching back to the SCG resources.

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

## Appendix A.f: 20.Q1: Downlink Packet Forwarding at Secondary Node Release Procedure for NR in EN-DC

Downlink packet forwarding is supported in EN-DC during the Secondary Node Release

procedure.

| Feature Name:           | LTE-NR Dual Connectivity        |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4908                    |

| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002                    |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node             |
| Access Type:            | NR                              |

During the Secondary Node Release procedure, bearer resources allowed to be Secondary

Node terminated Split DRBs are moved from the Secondary Node to the Master Node.

Downlink packet forwarding is performed between the Split DRBs in the Secondary Node and

the MCG bearers in the Master Node.

Downlink packet forwarding is always enabled and not controlled by MO configuration.

Capacity and Performance

By minimizing downlink packet loss during the Secondary Node Release procedure, data

retransmission and TCP slow start can be avoided.

Operation

The following PM counters on the gNodeB include forwarded

packet count in downlink for each QCI during the Secondary Node Release

procedure:

- X2ULink.pmPdcpPktFwdTransDlQos
- X2ULink.pmPdcpPktFwdTransDlDiscQos

The following flexible counters on the eNodeB include

forwarded packet count in EN-DC during the Secondary Node Release procedure:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmFlexPdcpPktFwdDl
- EUtranCellFDD.pmFlexPdcpPktDiscDlHo
- EUtranCellTDD.pmFlexPdcpPktFwdDl
- EUtranCellTDD.pmFlexPdcpPktDiscDlHo

The following PM counters on the eNodeB include forwarded

packet count in EN-DC during the Secondary Node Release procedure:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpPktFwdDl
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpPktDiscDlHo
- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpPktDiscDlHoQci

## Appendix A.g: 20.Q2: NR Coverage Triggered Secondary Node Release

This

enhancement supports the A2 measurement report-triggered Secondary Node Initiated Secondary

Node Release procedure in EN-DC.

| Feature Name:           | LTE-NR Dual Connectivity   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4908               |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package            |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002               |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node        |
| Access Type:            | NR                         |

Benefits

This enhancement allows the configuration of the critical RSRP level to trigger an A2

measurement event-based Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Release procedure.

This configuration of the critical RSRP levels allows for controlling mobility at

poor NR coverage. The configuration is profile-based, and applies to the serving

PSCell.

The UE is configured with a critical level of RSRP applicable in the PSCell at EN-DC

setup. The UE performs A2 measurements on the RSRP level of the PSCell. If the

measured RSRP level falls below the critical level configured to the UE for a longer

duration than the time to trigger, the UE sends the A2 measurement report to the

Secondary Node. At the reception of the measurement report, the Secondary Node

initiates the Secondary Node Release procedure.

This enhancement has the following benefits:

- The UE is not required to keep the SCG resources until the indication of RLF in the Secondary Node. This results in reduced throughput degradation to the UE in downlink and uplink.
- The number of RLF-triggered Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Release procedures is reduced.
- The following KPIs show a lower value: DL Packet Loss Captured in gNodeB UL Packet Loss Captured in gNodeB

Capacity and Performance

The A2 measurement event triggers the Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Release

procedure before an NR RLF occurs. During the Secondary Node Release procedure, the

Secondary Node Addition procedure is triggered. As a result, the number of the

Secondary Node Addition procedure increases.

Operation

The enhancement introduces the following MO classes for the NR Coverage Triggered

Secondary Node Release procedure to configure the critical RSRP on the PSCell

level:

- McpcPSCellProfile The cell referring to this profile is used as a PSCell for the UE.
- Mcpc The container for the PSCell level profiles.

This enhancement introduces the following profile-based attributes for the NR

Coverage Triggered Secondary Node Release procedure to configure the critical RSRP

on the PSCell level:

- NRCellCU.mcpcEnabled
- NRCellCU.mcpcPSCellProfileRef
- McpcPSCellProfile.rsrpCriticalEnabled
- McpcPSCellProfile.rsrpCritical The enhancement introduces the ReportConfigA1A2Rsrp struct in the McpcPSCellProfile.rsrpCritical attribute. The struct has the following members: hysteresis threshold timeToTrigger

This enhancement has an impact on the following counters:

- NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalSgnb The PM counter value is lower because of the reduced number of abnormal Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Release procedures.
- NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeNormal The PM counter value is higher because of the increased number of the Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Release procedures.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

To fully benefit from the change, the node requires support from the following

network elements:

- ENM ENM version 20.2 or later is required for this enhancement.
- eNodeB with the Basic Intelligent Connectivity feature activated. Depending on the configuration of the B1 measurement, it is possible that the UE is directed to the PSCell with the previously configured critical RSRP level. This can increase the subsequent Secondary Node Addition and Secondary Node Initiated Secondary Node Release procedures.

## Appendix A.h: 20.Q2: UE Capability Check for EN-DC

The enhancement enables the configuration of UEs for EN-DC setup based on their

reported capabilities.

Benefits

The enhancement offers the following benefits:

- Possibility to configure UEs based on their different capabilities.
- Possibility to reject UEs that do not support the capabilities required by the network.

During the capability check, the reported UE capabilities are compared with the

supported network configurations. If the check is successful, the EN-DC setup is

continued. If the check is unsuccessful, the gNodeB rejects the EN-DC setup

attempt.

E-RAB release of DRBs terminated in the Secondary Node (both Secondary Node terminated

split and Secondary Node terminated MCG) is supported. The UE remains connected and all

E-RABs not requested to be released remain with the same configuration as before the

E-RAB release.

Benefits

At the E-RAB Release procedure of a Secondary Node terminated DRB (split and MCG),

the UE is not released, but remains connected. This leads to decreased

drop rates and increased retainability.

Benefits

This enhancement adds support for setting up Secondary Node-terminated E-RABs. One or

more new bearers can be set up, even if the corresponding DRB belongs to one of the

following types:

- Secondary Node-terminated MCG bearer
- Secondary Node-terminated split bearer

The E-RABs that are set up can also be configured to be Master Node-terminated,

Secondary Node-terminated, or both.

Capacity and Performance

PM and observability events are updated for the eNodeB and the gNodeB. For all of the

Benefits

The main benefit of the feature enhancement is the increased number of node

connections in EN-DC.

Capacity and Performance

The number of EN-DC X2 connections is increased from 64 to 256.

The enhancement allows a maximum of 256 EN-DC X2 connections for each gNodeB or

eNodeB.

Operation

The following MOs are used to configure EN-DC X2 connections:

- ExternalGNodeBFunction (LTE)
- ExternalENodeBFunction (NR)
- TermPointToGNB (LTE)
- TermPointToENodeB (NR)

The total number of direct X2 IPsec tunnels is 512. The direct X2 IPsec tunnels

include both EN-DC X2 and LTE X2 connections.

If more than 512 X2 connections are anticipated, direct X2 IPsec can be enabled for

EN-DC X2 only by setting the ENodeBFunction.ipsecEndcEpAddressRef

attribute. In this case, the ENodeBFunction.ipsecEpAddressRef

attribute must not be set.

When exceeding the limit of direct X2 IPsec VPN connections, the remaining X2 traffic is

sent through the Security Gateway. This traffic is still protected by IPsec, but delays can be anticipated.

The feature enhancement has no effect on the total number of GTP-U paths with a

unique combination of local IP address and remote IP address. Hence, the total

number of GTP-U paths can be a maximum of 576.

It is required to plan the deployment manually to keep the total number of the

specified GTP-U paths in LTE and NR within a limit of 576.

- LTE: X2-U, EN-DC X2-U, and S1-U
- NR: Xn-U, NG-U, EN-DC X2-U, and S1-U

Exceeding the limit causes the failure of additional GTP-U session setup since GTP-U

paths cannot be created.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No special hardware requirements.

Benefits

No impact.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

EN-DC setup considers which PLMNs are supported in the NR cells, and

mobility restrictions for UEs. The cells in the gNodeB need to be updated with all

available PLMNs in the NR cells before upgrading. This ensures that the eNodeB

receives served cell information from the gNodeBs, which contain information about

available PLMNs.

In case the operator is using more than one PLMN after node upgrade, the split bearer

will not be established for the PLMNs that are not configured on the gNodeB.

Before the eNodeB upgrade, make sure that PLMNs are properly configured on gNodeB NR

cells by setting NRCellDU.pLMNIdList to available PLMNs.

## Appendix A.m: 20.Q3: EN-DC-Triggered Handover at Incoming Handover

The feature supports the handover of an EN-DC-capable UE in connected mode from an

LTE cell where setting up SCG resources is not possible or from an LTE cell supporting

EN-DC, triggered at an incoming

handover.

Benefits

The feature is used to move an EN-DC-capable UE in connected mode, triggered at an

incoming handover, to a neighboring LTE cell that supports EN-DC in the following

cases:

- Handover is triggered in an LTE cell where setting up SCG resources is not possible. The purpose of the handover is to move the UE that is unable to set up SCG resources in a cell, to a neighboring LTE cell where setting up SCG resources is possible.
- Handover is triggered at incoming handover in an LTE cell where setting up SCG resources is possible. The purpose of the handover is to move the UE to a neighboring LTE cell where it can set up a better EN-DC connection than the EN-DC connection the UE uses originally.

The feature supports inter-frequency handover at the completion of incoming

IRAT and incoming intra-LTE handovers.

With the feature activated, the eNodeB considers the following when selecting the

target LTE cell:

- NR coverage
- Prioritized NR frequencies
- Band combinations supported by the UE

With the feature activated, the UE has a better chance to be connected through EN-DC

with better throughput.

Capacity and Performance

The subscriber capacity is slightly lowered because of increased CPU load. The

feature relies on UE inter-frequency measurements to identify the UE that is

suitable for EN-DC-triggered handover.

An increase in the RRC signaling associated with inter-frequency measurements and the

handover-related signaling can be expected. When using this feature, the number of

inter-frequency handovers increases even in good radio conditions.

Operation

The benefits of the enhancement can be observed with the Handover Success Rate

KPI.

This feature introduces the following counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellHoPrepAttLteInterFEndcHo
- EUtranCellTDD.pmCellHoPrepAttLteInterFEndcHo
- EUtranCellFDD.pmCellHoPrepSuccLteInterFEndcHo

Benefits

The enhancement introduces a new parameter in the eNodeB that enables the operator to

select the method of carrier aggregation configuration in EN-DC. This allows setting

the band combination coordination in EN-DC in a way that the NR carrier aggregation

throughput is maximized first.

Capacity and Performance

The enhancement increases NR carrier aggregation throughput while aiming to maximize

LTE throughput at the same time.

Operation

An increase in the value of the following PI formula is expected with the

NR-preferred setting:

Increased SCell throughput in gNodeB can be observed with the following existing

counters:

- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDl
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlScell
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlSCellExt

An increased number of SCell configurations can be observed with the

NRCellCU.pmCaConfigDlSumEndcDistr counter.

| Licensing               | Basic feature. No license is required. |

This enhancement introduces the following benefits:

- The prioritization of NR frequencies within a priority group for B1 measurements.
- The ability to set a timer to restart the B1 measurements with the same NR frequencies used in the previous B1 measurements.

Capacity and Performance

This enhancement introduces the following counters:

- EUtranCellFDD.pmB1MeasRepEndcConfigRestart
- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcScgFailureArfcnNil
- EUtranCellTDD.pmB1MeasRepEndcConfigRestart
- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcScgFailureArfcnNil

Operation

This enhancement introduces the following MO parameter:

- UeMeasControl.endcMeasRestartTime

The value of the UeMeasControl.endcMeasRestartTime MO must be

appropriately configured by considering the following aspects:

- A smaller value can increase RRC signaling load and decrease cell throughput, although it can provide more chances to establish an EN-DC connection.
- A value that is too large decreases the chances of EN-DC setup.

For typical radio network environments, it is recommended to use the

UeMeasControl.endcMeasRestartTime MO with the range between

10 to 15 seconds.

## Appendix A.q: 21.Q2: LTE Handover without Secondary Node Change

With this enhancement, UE context is kept in the gNodeB during LTE X2 handover, and

the same PSCell is reused after handover.

| Feature Name:           | LTE-NR Dual Connectivity                                |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|

| Access Type:            | NR                                                      |

This enhancement triggers a Secondary Node addition procedure between the target PCell

and the PSCell. It also triggers a Secondary Node release procedure between the source

PCell and the PSCell.

This way, during the LTE X2 handover, the EN-DC connection to the current PSCell is kept

in the target PCell instead of an EN-DC release.

Benefits

This enhancement has the following benefits:

- EN-DC connection to the UE is maintained during LTE handover if the PSCell is kept.
- NR interruption time is decreased during LTE handover for the EN-DC-capable UE.
- User plane delay is minimized for the Secondary Node-terminated split DRB.
- Signaling is reduced as the UE context is kept in the gNodeB, even at security key refresh after LTE handover.

Capacity and Performance

NR throughput is increased because of the reduced NR interruption time during LTE

handover. In addition, EN-DC setup latency is improved.

Operation

This enhancement introduces the CuCpProcEndcMnHoKeepSnPM

event.

This enhancement introduces the following PM counters to monitor the number of

PSCells kept during LTE X2 handover:

- NRCellCU.pmEndcMnHoPSCellKeepAtt
- NRCellCU.pmEndcMnHoPSCellKeepSucc

This enhancement decreases the following NR PM counters:

- NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupUeAtt
- NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupUeSucc
- NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeNormal

This enhancement increases the following NR PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeDlDrb
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrb

This enhancement increases the Average DL MAC DRB Throughput KPI.

| Licensing:              | Basic feature. No license is required.                  |

Benefits

The feature enhancement offers the following benefits:

- Increased chance of setting up EN-DC connectivity to the UE.
- With customized B1 measurement timer settings for different subscribers, NR frequencies can be always made available for specific subscribers.

Capacity and Performance

If always set to activated, B1 measurement to find proper NR coverage is always

available to fixed wireless devices belonging to the specific subscriber group to

increase capacity. However, this also results in a slight decrease in

throughput.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

If setting up EN-DC for a UE fails because of insufficient UE capabilities, the Secondary

Node sends an X2AP SGNB ADDITION REQUEST REJECT message with a

radioNetwork.unspecified cause value to the eNodeB, and the

corresponding NR frequency is blocklisted for the UE. As a result, the corresponding NR

frequency cannot be used for Secondary Node addition requests.

The frequency blocklisting function inhibits the automatic B1 measurements and the

subsequent X2AP SGNB ADDITION REQUEST REJECT messages, which would affect

the KPIs in a negative way.

Benefits

The feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- Higher EN-DC setup success rates
- Reduced number of EN-DC setup attempts

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement provides a slight improvement in performance as no B1

measurement is performed for non-used NR frequencies.

## Appendix A.v: 21.Q3: Intra-Band EN-DC Blocking

This feature enhancement allows the blocking of intra-band EN-DC in case of

overlapping bands.

| Access Type:            | NR                         |

Benefits

This

feature enhancement can decrease the number of EN-DC setup

failures. Faulty UE configuration with overlapping bands can be

avoided.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement can improve

the

success rate for EN-DC setup measured in gNodeB.

Depending on UE behavior, UE population and network deployment, the success rate for

EN-DC setup can increase.

Operation

In case of overlapping bands, one of the bands can be used. The Master eNodeB PCell

band has precedence over Secondary gNodeB PSCell and SCell bands. The Secondary

gNodeB PSCell and SCell bands has precedence over Master eNodeB SCell bands.

All potential blocking capabilities can be found by comparing operating bands of the

LTE cells with the operating bands of the NR cells, as defined in

NRFrequency.bandList. If NRFrequency.bandListManual is

configured, the related values are used instead of

NRFrequency.bandList.

Interfaces

## Appendix A.w: 21.Q4: Buffer-Based EN-DC Setup

This feature enhancement allows for the configuration of the eNodeB behavior to set

up EN-DC based on the user plane conditions of the

UE.

| Feature Name:           | LTE-NR Dual Connectivity   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4908               |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package            |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002               |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node        |
| Access Type:            | NR                         |

Summary and Benefits

This enhancement provides the following benefits for UEs with short data

sessions:

- Eliminates user plane interruption that is caused by unnecessary EN-DC setup, based on the UE buffer status.
- Improves the UE battery consumption by avoiding unnecessary SCG configuration.
- Reduces the traffic and signaling load on the Secondary Node.
- Supports avoiding unnecessary B1 measurement configuration with measurement gap for EN-DC setup. Note: Uplink throughput gain is expected when the B1 measurement configuration is not triggered.

Capacity and Performance

User plane interruption might happen because of intra-cell handover as EN-DC setup

can be triggered during downlink data transfer.

The UE battery consumption can be improved and the traffic and signaling load on the

Secondary Node can be reduced.

The EN-DC setup and the SCG addition can be delayed or not be triggered. EN-DC setup

and SCG addition are triggered when the downlink user plane traffic exceeds the

threshold.

Uplink heavy traffic might not trigger B1 measurement configuration for the EN-DC

setup if the generated downlink data is not enough. As a result, uplink peak

throughput might not be reachable.

The time to reach stable downlink peak throughput might be delayed because the EN-DC

setup is delayed as much as downlink buffer monitoring time.

Operation

This enhancement can be activated on the eNodeB by setting any of the following

attributes to a value other than 0:

- EUtranCellFDD.endcSetupDlPktAgeThr
- EUtranCellFDD.endcSetupDlPktVolThr
- EUtranCellTDD.endcSetupDlPktAgeThr
- EUtranCellTDD.endcSetupDlPktVolThr

| Access Type:            | NR                         |

Summary and Benefits

The enhancement introduces a configuration that supports the exchange of the UE

capability information in three parallel messages between the EN-DC-capable UE and

the eNodeB. The parallel transfer method aims to prevent the latency increase at

connection setup. Sending the RRC UECapabilityEnquiry request in

three messages provides the eNodeB the possibility to receive the complete UE

capability information without information loss caused by message size. The

configuration makes a large number of EN-DC band combinations available and the UE

has increased possibility to use its capabilities to set up a connection. As a

result, the best possible connection can be set up for an EN-DC-capable UE regarding

carrier aggregation and EN-DC setup.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The feature introduces the configuration of the

ENodeBFunction.ueCapabilityEnquirySteps attribute. The

operator can set the following values:

- ONE\_STEP
- TWO\_STEP
- THREE\_STEP

The THREE\_STEP configuration provides the benefits of this feature

enhancement.

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement enables a group of UEs defined in ASGH framework to use

custom B1 measurement thresholds. This allows for differentiated B1 measurement

configuration for designated UEs. UEs belonging to this specific subscriber group

can have a higher chance to connect to NR frequencies providing higher

throughput.

Capacity and Performance

When subscriber group-specific B1 thresholds are configured, throughput-related

integrity KPIs can be impacted in the following way:

- If the B1 threshold is lowered, the integrity KPI related to throughput from gNodeB increases.
- If the B1 threshold is raised, the integrity KPI related to throughput from gNodeB decreases.

Operation

The feature enhancement allows the NR Restriction function to be enabled or disabled

on the Master Node. When the NR Restriction function is disabled, UEs with NR Restriction

are permitted to access Low-Band, Mid-Band, and High-Band NR frequencies for EN-DC

setup.

| Feature Name           | LTE-NR Dual Connectivity   |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4908               |

| Access Type            | NR                         |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                   |

Summary and Benefits

With proper NR Restriction configuration, NR-restricted UEs can access High-Band

frequencies on top of Low-Band and Mid-Band NR frequencies for EN-DC. The feature

enhancement uses a temporary attribute for enabling and disabling NR Restriction,

and this function interacts with the Enhanced NR Restriction feature.

Capacity and Performance

The number of successful EN-DC setups for NR-restricted UEs is expected to increase

depending on UE capabilities.

Integrity KPIs related to throughput might improve if NR-restricted UEs can access NR

frequencies.

If the NR Restriction function is disabled, PM counters related to the LTE-NR Dual

Connectivity and the PSCell Change to Higher Priority features, or the EN-DC

function in the NR Mobility feature either increase or remain the same under the

following MOs:

- NRCellCU
- NRCellDU
- PpControlLink
- X2UTermination
- X2ULink

If the NR Restriction function is configured differently on the different Master

Nodes in the network, the LTE Handover without Secondary Node Change function in the

LTE-NR Dual Connectivity feature might not be triggered in the source LTE anchor

cell. This can cause EN-DC setup-related PM counters to increase. However, the

following PM counters might decrease:

- NRCellCU.pmEndcMnHoPSCellKeepAtt
- NRCellCU.pmEndcMnHoPSCellKeepSucc

Operation

The configuration of NR Restriction on the Master Node has the following impact:

- If NR Restriction is disabled, NR restricted UEs are allowed to use Low-Band, Mid-Band, and High-Band frequencies.
- If NR Restriction is enabled and the Enhanced NR Restriction feature is activated, NR-restricted UEs are allowed to use Low-Band and Mid-Band, but not High-Band frequencies.
- If NR Restriction is enabled and the Enhanced NR Restriction feature is not activated, NR-restricted UEs are not allowed to use SCG radio resources.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

Other Network Elements

It is recommended to use ENM version 22.4 or later to support the

MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence

## Appendix A.ag: 22.Q4: Frequency-Differentiated B1 Measurement Trigger Time and Quantity Configuration for EN-DC

This feature enhancement allows the configuration of a different triggering time for

EN-DC B1 measurements for each LTE-to-NR frequency relation. An overriding attribute for

trigger quantity is also introduced.

| Feature Name           | LTE-NR Dual Connectivity   |

| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4908               |
| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package            |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4002               |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                   |

Summary and Benefits

Multiple B1 measurements can be configured for the UE with different times to trigger

the B1 measurement for each NR frequency in an LTE-to-NR frequency relation. The

Master Node can apply a waiting time for the B1 measurement report, which is

calculated based on the following values:

- The configured time during which the UE can perform B1 measurements.
- The largest time to trigger value for a B1 measurement for a frequency relation. If this is not configured, the cell-level trigger time configuration is used.

The trigger quantity of the B1 measurements can also be configured for the different

frequency relations. This way, different NR frequencies can be assigned different

trigger quantities for triggering EN-DC setup.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Different NR frequencies can be treated according to operator requirements to trigger EN-DC setup with the optimized trigger time and trigger quantity.
- Different NR frequencies in the same priority group can be further prioritized for EN-DC setup on the frequency range level. This is done in a single RRC RRCConnectionReconfiguration message, reducing RRC signaling load.

Capacity and Performance

The number of successful EN-DC setups can increase or decrease depending on the

trigger time and trigger quantity configuration on the Master Node on the different

LTE-to-NR frequency relations. The EN-DC Setup Success Rate Captured in gNodeB KPI

shows the change in the number of successful EN-DC setups.

When the trigger time overriding attribute value is lower than the cell-level trigger

time value, a higher number of EN-DC setups is possible. As a result, the number of

EN-DC setup failures can also increase. However, if the trigger time overriding

attribute value is higher than the cell-level trigger time value, the number of

possible EN-DC setups decreases. This might result in a decrease in EN-DC setup

failures. The behavior can be observed with the following cell-level and cell

relation-level PM counters:

- NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupUeAtt
- NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupUeSucc
- NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupScgUeAtt
- NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupScgUeSucc
- NRCellCU.pmEndcMnHoPSCellKeepAtt
- NRCellCU.pmEndcMnHoPSCellKeepSucc

Integrity-related uplink and downlink KPIs might be affected as EN-DC is set up for

some NR frequencies more than for others.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

## Appendix A.ah: 23.Q1: Controlling EN-DC Setup on LTE-to-NR Cell Relation Level

The feature enhancement introduces the option in the Master Node to restrict EN-DC

setup by configuration on LTE-to-NR cell relation level.

| Feature Name           | LTE-NR Dual Connectivity   |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4908               |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                   |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement introduces a configuration option in the Master Node to block

B1 measurement-based EN-DC setup on LTE-to-NR cell relation level for neighbor NR

cells. This allows

the

option to ignore NR cells with poor radio link quality during

EN-DC setup.

This feature enhancement improves service quality, as it is possible to allow only NR

cells with good radio link quality to be considered for B1 measurement-based EN-DC

setup.

Capacity and Performance

If the B1 measurement-based EN-DC setup is blocked by configuration for the cell

relation that references an NR cell with poor radio link quality, the following

changes can be observed:

- The Random Access Success Rate Captured in gNodeB KPI might improve.
- The following PM counters might decrease: NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupUeAtt NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupUeSucc NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupScgUeAtt NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupScgUeSucc NRCellCU.pmEndcCaConfigAtt NRCellCU.pmEndcCaConfigSucc NRCellDU.pmRadioRaCbAttMsg2
- The following EBS counters might decrease: pmEbsEndcSetupScgUeAtt pmEbsEndcSetupScgUeSucc pmEbsEndcSetupUeAtt pmEbsEndcSetupUeSucc pmEbsEndcSetupDrbAtt pmEbsEndcSetupScgDrbAtt For information on the EBS counters, see Lists and Delta Lists.
- The following PM counters might decrease: NRCellCU.pmEndcMnHoPSCellKeepAtt NRCellCU.pmEndcMnHoPSCellKeepSucc

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces a configurable attribute on the Master Node that

can be used to block NR cells on LTE-to-NR cell relation level for B1

measurement-based EN-DC setup.

During PSCell Change, the target PSCell is not validated by the Master Node. This can

result in an EN-DC setup to the target PSCell even if the cell is referenced in an

LTE-to-NR cell relation that does not allow EN-DC setup.

To avoid EN-DC setups to unwanted NR cells at PSCell Change, the following

configuration options are available:

- The following ANR-specific thresholds can be configured for intra-frequency PSCell Change to avoid creating NR-to-NR cell relations to unwanted neighbor cells: AnrFunctionNRUeCfg.anrRsrpThreshold AnrFunctionNRUeCfg.anrRsrqThreshold
- The NRCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute can be configured in existing NR-to-NR cell relations according to the following steps: The lightweight object is manually promoted to create the NRCellCU.NRCellRelation MO instance. The NRCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute is set to false.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                  |

Summary and Benefits

The existing MCG and SCG radio resource switching algorithms are updated to provide

more balanced resource switching in poor radio conditions or low user activity on

High-Band.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Improved robustness of radio resource switching
- More balanced algorithm for radio resource switching to High-Band
- Improved downlink radio resource switching to suppress ping-pong effect, that is, switching back and forth between SCG and MCG in poor radio conditions

Capacity and Performance

In poor radio conditions on High-Band, a slight decrease in the

NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalMenb and the

NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalSgnb PM counters can be expected.

The decrease is more likely if the NRCellDU.endcDlNrLowQualThresh

and the NRCellDU.endcUlNrLowQualThresh attribute values are set

below the recommended levels.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                  |

Summary and Benefits

In Low-Band and Mid-Band, if the UE quickly moves out of the NR cell coverage, the

detection of CRC failures and Discontinuous Transmissions in uplink causes the

gNodeB to switch to the MCG radio resources regardless of the estimated radio

quality of the NR link. This can be described as an out-of-coverage triggered switch

from SCG to MCG.

The updated MCG and SCG radio resource switching algorithms provide more balanced

resource switching when CRC failures and Discontinuous Transmissions in uplink are

detected. The criteria for the out-of-coverage triggered switch in Low-Band and

Mid-Band are adjusted to the following conditions:

- Require a higher number of Discontinuous Transmissions in uplink before switching from SCG.
- Require more successful transmissions in the SCG before allowing a switch back from MCG to SCG.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Improved robustness of radio resource switching from and to SCG.
- Improved uplink radio resource switching to suppress ping-pong effect, that is, switching back and forth between SCG and MCG.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

This feature enhancement has an impact on the

GNBCUUFunction.pmProhibitTimerRefuseUlLegSwitch PM counter.

The GNBCUUFunction.pmProhibitTimerRefuseUlLegSwitch PM counter is

used to monitor how many times the uplink radio resource switching to SCG radio

resources is rejected. The testing result shows that the number of the rejection

times is decreased substantially.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                  |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces gNodeB support for the PARTIAL RESET

REQUIRED and PARTIAL RESET CONFIRM messages as defined in

3GPP TS 36.423 version 16.2.0 or later. With the implementation of

this feature enhancement, PARTIAL RESET REQUIRED messages that are

sent by the gNodeB are no longer discarded by the eNodeB.

Partial reset consists of the following steps:

1. The eNodeB receives the PARTIAL RESET REQUIRED message.
2. The eNodeB responds with the PARTIAL RESET CONFIRM message to the gNodeB.
3. All resources used by the UE that are included in the PARTIAL RESET REQUIRED message are released by the eNodeB.

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- The ability to release only some of the UE that use the interface
- Reduced risk of issues with inter-vendor EN-DC configurations where the gNodeB belongs to a different vendor
- Possibility of future improvements on the gNodeB side

Capacity and Performance

Depending on the use case, this feature enhancement can have the following impact on

the network:

- It can reduce periods without UE traffic.
- It can cause UE traffic interruption in cases in which the UE is released but tries to continue the traffic. In these cases, the UE needs to establish a new connection.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the following PM events:

- CuCpX2PartialResetRequired
- CuCpX2PartialResetConfirm
- CuCpXnResetRequest
- CuCpXnResetResponse

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                   |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement allows the Master Node to be configured to block NR

frequencies on which a specific UE experiences recurring EN-DC failures.

The recurring EN-DC setup failure is detected for the UE on a specific NR frequency

when the UE repeatedly encounters RLF after a short EN-DC session time at EN-DC

setup.

The NR frequency with repeated short EN-DC session times is added to a blocklist in

the Master Node for a time interval that can be configured. While the NR frequency

is on the blocklist, it cannot be used for EN-DC setup for the UE.

The feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- The EN-DC retainability KPI is improved when recurring EN-DC failures are prevented.
- By blocking specific NR frequencies causing recurring EN-DC setup failures, EN-DC can be established for the UE on other NR frequencies and the end-user experience improves.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement improves the

SCG

Active Radio Resource Retainability, Captured in gNodeB KPI.

The SCG Active Radio Resource Retainability, Captured in gNodeB KPI can degrade

because of the increased possibility of NR random access failure.

The following PM counters might increase for EN-DC radio resource setup if EN-DC

setup is attempted for the NR cell that has a more suitable configuration in case of

a PCI conflict:

- NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupUeAtt
- NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupUeSucc
- NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupScgUeAtt
- NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupScgUeSucc
- NRCellCU.pmEndcCaConfigAtt
- NRCellCU.pmEndcCaConfigSucc

The following EBS counters might increase for EN-DC radio resource setup if EN-DC

setup is attempted for the NR cell that has a more suitable configuration in case of

a PCI conflict:

- pmEbsEndcSetupScgUeAtt
- pmEbsEndcSetupScgUeSucc
- pmEbsEndcSetupUeAtt
- pmEbsEndcSetupUeSucc
- pmEbsEndcSetupDrbAtt
- pmEbsEndcSetupScgDrbAtt

These EBS counters are associated with the NRCellCU MO. For

more information on EBS counters, see Lists and Delta Lists.

The following PM counters might increase for LTE mobility without PSCell change if

EN-DC setup is successful for the NR cell that has a more suitable configuration in

case of a PCI conflict:

- NRCellCU.pmEndcMnHoPSCellKeepAtt
- NRCellCU.pmEndcMnHoPSCellKeepSucc

The following PM counters might increase because of the increased possibility of NR

random access failure:

- NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalMenb

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                  |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement prevents unnecessary EN-DC setup attempts and unwanted LTE

RRC Connection Re-establishment after PSCell change during the Master Node Initiated

Secondary Node Modification procedure.

This is only applicable when intra-band EN-DC is blocked.

Capacity and Performance

The decrease in the number of EN-DC setup attempts can be observed with the

NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupUeAtt PM counter.

The increase in the number of successful PSCell changes can be observed with the

NRCellCU.pmEndcPSCellChangeSuccIntraSgnb PM counter.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

The feature enhancement affects the X2-C interface because the X2AP protocol is

updated to support the SCG-related overheating information. In case of the X2AP

protocol, the SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST message is updated.

During the Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure, the

SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST message also contains the PCell

frequency information, except during SCG release.

The Secondary Node uses this information to prevent intra-band EN-DC configuration

when performing PSCell and SCell selection. The Secondary Node sends the PSCell and

SCell frequency information to the Master Node using the SGNB MODIFICATION

REQUIRED message. The Master Node uses this information to prevent

intra-band EN-DC configuration when performing SCell selection.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                   |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement introduces a configurable list of the LTE frequencies on the

Master Node that are not allowed for EN-DC for each NR frequency relation.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits based on the configuration:

- Possibility to prohibit EN-DC setup when EN-DC-triggered handover is more beneficial due to the target cell having higher priority or performance.
- Possibility to prohibit EN-DC-triggered handover to the target LTE cells in which EN-DC setup is not possible.

Capacity and Performance

The feature enhancement increases the probability to setup EN-DC on the highest

prioritized NR carrier frequency in coverage, which improves the EN-DC

performance.

Operation

The feature enhancement introduces the

GUtranFreqRelation.endcNotAllowedEUtranFreqRef attribute that

allows the operator to configure the list of the LTE frequencies that are not

allowed for EN-DC for each NR frequency relation.

## Appendix A.at: 23.Q4: Dynamic QoS Modification in EN-DC

The feature enhancement allows the dynamic modification of the QoS properties of

already established Secondary Node terminated DRBs in EN-DC.

| Feature Name           | LTE-NR Dual Connectivity   |

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                  |

Summary and Benefits

With the feature enhancement, the EPC can dynamically modify the QCI and the

Allocation and Retention Priority

(ARP)

parameters of an already established Secondary Node terminated DRBs. The

modification is validated in the Master Node and the Secondary Node, and it is

signaled to the UE by the Master Node.

The dynamic modification of QoS properties provides increased flexibility when

changing the characteristics of the service in EN-DC.

Capacity and Performance

The UE throughput might degrade during dynamic QoS modification.

During the modification of QoS parameters of Secondary Node terminated DRBs, the

number of Master Node initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure failures might

increase. As a result, the number of Secondary Node Release procedure might increase

leading to lower throughput for the UE.

The following PM counters might increase in the Secondary Node:

- NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupUeSucc
- NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupUeAtt

The SCG Active Radio Resource Retainability, Captured in gNodeB KPI might degrade.

The NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalMenbAct PM counter is impacted.

This effect can be observed in the Secondary Node.

Operation

The dynamic QoS modification of Secondary Node terminated DRBs is done through the

Master Node Initiated Secondary Node Modification procedure.

The CUCP5qi.rlcMode attribute in the Secondary Node are not

allowed to be modified in an established Secondary Node terminated split DRB.

If the QoS modification affects these attributes, the QoS modification request is

rejected. As a result, the Master Node initiated Secondary Node Modification

procedure fails and the Secondary Node starts the Secondary Node Release procedure

for the UE.

The feature enhancement updates the

CuCpProcX2MnInitiatedSgnbModification event in the Secondary

Node.

Interfaces

The feature enhancement updates the X2AP SGNB MODIFICATION REQUEST

message with information on the modification of QoS properties of E-RABs and

Secondary Node terminated DRBs over the X2-C interface.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional            | Optional                   |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement allows the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage function to

detect poor UE downlink quality and to perform mobility based on the downlink

quality of the source cell and the target cell. The feature enhancement also

introduces support for performing an additional evaluation of a reported target cell

by checking a reported quantity that is different from the trigger quantity.

The feature enhancement also allows the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage function to

configure the UE to detect both poor RSRP and poor downlink quality. If the

detection of both poor RSRP and poor downlink quality is enabled, separate

measurements are configured in parallel in the UE for RSRP and the downlink quality

trigger quantity.

The feature enhancement introduces support for operators to configure the upper limit

of the number of NR inter-frequency measurements and IRAT measurements that the

gNodeB requests the UE to perform.

The feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Reduced number of dropped calls for UEs in cells with high interference
- Reduced throughput degradation for UEs in cells with high interference
- Reduced number of handovers and PSCell changes to cells with high interference

Other Network Elements

- ENM It is recommended to use ENM version 23.4 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.
- UE To fully benefit from this feature enhancement, UEs that are capable of SINR measurements are required. Some UEs cannot perform viable SINR measurements under certain conditions, for example, when SINR measurements are performed on Low-Band or Mid-Band frequencies and the PSCell of the UE is in a High-Band cell. This might result in the degradation of the following KPIs in EN-DC deployments: SCG Active Radio Resource Retainability considering EN-DC connectivity, Captured in gNodeB EN-DC inter-sgNodeB PSCell Change success rate captured in gNodeB EN-DC intra-sgNodeB PSCell Change success rate captured in gNodeB EN-DC Setup Success Rate Captured in gNodeB This KPI degradation can be mitigated by applying a different Mobility Control at Poor Coverage function configuration for UEs that have SINR measurement problems. For such UEs, a configuration that does not rely on any SINR measurements is recommended, which can be achieved by using the UE Grouping Framework. For more information, see the Handling UEs with Hard Limitations section in UE Grouping Framework.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                   |

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement allows the Master Node to add overloaded NR cells to a

denylist. Cells added to the denylist are excluded from EN-DC-related procedures and

IRAT Handover procedures to NR SA. The period for which a cell remains in the

denylist is configurable.

The feature enhancement provides the following benefits:

- The signaling load is reduced in the Secondary Node for the following procedures: EN-DC setup SCG Addition Outgoing NR IRAT Handover
- Improved success rate of EN-DC procedures and IRAT Handover procedures to NR SA by excluding overloaded cells from the procedures.

The feature enhancement only considers Secondary Node Addition or SCG Addition

procedure failures. If the overloaded NR cell is only used in NR SA, handover

failures caused by overloaded cell do not trigger the feature enhancement. As a

result, the cell is not added to the denylist and it is not excluded from IRAT

Handover procedures.

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement enables setting up an individual B1 threshold offset for

EN-DC Setup in the Master Node for each PSCell.

The feature enhancement is useful in cases when different radio units with different

capabilities are deployed in the NR cells that use the same frequency and share the

same LTE anchor cell. Depending on the radio unit capabilities, configuring the B1

threshold offset individually for each PSCell can provide the following

benefits:

- It allows full coverage for NR cells in radio units that can use lower B1 thresholds.
- It helps to avoid access failures for NR cells in radio units that require higher B1 threshold values.

Capacity and Performance

The number of EN-DC setup attempts is increased in the NR cells where the applied

PSCell-specific threshold offset decreases the B1 threshold.

The number of EN-DC setup attempts and access failures is decreased in the NR cells

where the applied PSCell-specific threshold offset increases the B1 threshold.

The following KPIs are increased by the feature enhancement:

- EN-DC Setup Success Rate Captured in gNodeB

- NRCellCU.pmEbsEndcRelUeAbnormalMenbActScgFailureType$

These EBS-N counters are associated with the NRCellCU MO class.

For more information on EBS-N counters, see Lists and Delta Lists.

The access failures in the NR cell can be monitored through the

RRC\_SCG\_FAILURE\_INFORMATION\_NR PM event with the following

event parameters:

- EVENT\_PARAM\_SCG\_FAILURE\_TYPE\_NR
- EVENT\_VALUE\_SCG\_SYNC\_FAILURE
- EVENT\_VALUE\_RA\_PROBLEM
- EVENT\_VALUE\_T310\_EXPIRY
- EVENT\_VALUE\_RLC\_MAX\_NUM\_RE\_TX
- EVENT\_VALUE\_SCG\_RECONFIG\_FAILURE
- EVENT\_VALUE\_SRB3\_INTEGRITY\_FAILURE

Operation

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                  | Mandatory                 |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Possibility to configure the preferred downlink cell group on 5QI and on QCI level, including the disabling of radio quality-triggered downlink cell group switching for Secondary Node terminated split DRBs.
- Possibility to tune the trade-off between rapid switching of downlink MCG and SCG radio resources of the Secondary Node terminated split DRB and air interface resource consumption by configuring aperiodic CSI periodicity for Low-Band and Mid-Band PSCells, if there is no data transmission.

Capacity and Performance

Changing aperiodic CSI periodicity can affect the following processes:

- Switching of downlink MCG and SCG radio resources of the Secondary Node terminated split DRB intensity between cell groups
- PDCCH and PUSCH load on SCG in EN-DC
- Traffic distribution between cell groups
- UE battery usage
- DRX sleep time on SCG in EN-DC

Configuring the preferred downlink cell group and the radio quality-triggered

switching of downlink MCG and SCG radio resources of the Secondary Node terminated

split DRB affect the traffic distribution between cell groups.

## Appendix A.ay: 24.Q2.0: Uplink Buffer-Based EN-DC Setup and Configuration Improvements on the Master Node

This feature enhancement enables EN-DC setups to be triggered based on uplink buffer

monitoring on the Master Node.

|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4908               |
| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package            |
| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4002               |

| Access Type            | NR                         |
| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                   |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement introduces uplink buffer monitoring for buffer-based EN-DC

setup in the Master Node. When uplink buffer monitoring is enabled, EN-DC setup is

only triggered for UEs with heavy traffic in uplink. Uplink and downlink buffer

monitoring can be configured separately or at the same time on the Master Node.

Activating uplink buffer monitoring can provide the following benefits:

- Reduced UE battery consumption
- Reduced RRC signaling
- Improved NR resource utilization

The feature enhancement also introduces a configuration option to prevent PSCell

changes during Master Node mobility. This decreases the number of PSCell

changes.

Capacity and Performance

With uplink buffer monitoring enabled in the Master Node, fewer UEs are configured

with EN-DC. This can result in an increased throughput on the Master Node which can

be observed as a decrease of the following PM counters:

- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDl
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrb
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrbQoS
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUl
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlResUe

The following PM counters can decrease because of the impact of uplink buffer-based

EN-DC setup on EN-DC setups and EN-DC-triggered handovers:

- NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupScgUeAtt
- NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupScgUeSucc
- NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupUeAtt
- NRCellCU.pmEndcSetupUeSucc
- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigDlSumEndcDistr
- NRCellCU.pmEndcCaConfigAtt
- NRCellCU.pmEndcCaConfigSucc
- NRCellCU.pmEndcCaDeconfigAtt
- NRCellCU.pmEndcCaDeconfigSucc
- NRCellCU.pmRrcConnLevelMaxEnDc
- NRCellCU.pmRrcConnLevelSumEnDc
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDl
- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUl
- PpControlLink.pmEndcNrDrbSetupAtt
- PpControlLink.pmEndcNrDrbSetupSucc

The following PM counters can increase in value when NR measurement reports are not

forwarded to the Secondary Node during Master Node-based mobility:

- NRCellCU.pmEndcMnHoPSCellKeepAtt
- NRCellCU.pmEndcMnHoPSCellKeepSucc

When NR measurement reports are not forwarded to the Secondary Node during Master

Node-based mobility observability related to the following features or functions

might decrease in value:

- NR Mobility
- NR carrier aggregation
- NR Minimization of Drive Tests

Operation

Configurable attributes are introduced on the Master Node for configuring the

following settings:

- The uplink data threshold for each cell and each user group
- The forwarding of NR measurement reports to the Secondary Node during Master Node-based mobility

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

For more information on EBS counter associated with the feature enhancement,

see Lists and Delta Lists.

Operation

This feature enhancement introduces the

EndcDistrProfile.mandatoryHiPrioGUtranFreqRef attribute to

define the list of higher-priority frequencies.

All frequencies defined in the

EndcDistrProfile.mandatoryHiPrioGUtranFreqRef attribute are

configured with a priority weight value. This feature enhancement can operate

separately or in combination with EN-DC user distribution attributes in the

following ways:

- Priority weight from the list of mandatory higher-priority frequencies only
- Priority weight from the mandatory higher-priority frequency list, and the mandatory frequency list
- Priority weight from the mandatory higher-priority frequency list, the mandatory frequency list, and the distribution model

As a result, these preferred frequencies are always prioritized over the

selected frequencies by the mandatory frequency list or the distribution model.

Reprioritization can be calculated using the enhanced distribution algorithm in the

following way:

- By defining the frequency in the mandatory higher prioritized frequency list
- By defining the frequency in the mandatory frequency list
- By defining the distribution model

The following cases can be configured:

- Reprioritized frequencies are only included in the mandatory higher priority frequency list.
- Reprioritized frequencies are included in the mandatory higher-priority frequency list and the distribution frequency list.
- Reprioritized frequencies are included in the mandatory higher-priority frequency list and the mandatory frequency list.
- Reprioritized frequencies are included in the mandatory higher-priority frequency list, the mandatory frequency list, and the distribution frequency list.
