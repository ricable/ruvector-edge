Summary

To avoid high inter-cell interference in parts of frequencies of the NR band, frequency

resource allocation is not limited to start from the lower edge of the frequency

range. Minimum Inter-Cell Interference Scheduling can be configured to start

frequency resource allocation at different PRB locations. These configuration

options are called strategies in the MOM.

# 3 Feature Operation of Minimum Inter-Cell Interference Scheduling

Minimum Inter-Cell Interference Scheduling can be configured to start frequency resource

allocation at different PRB locations.

Operational Process

1. The scheduler receives scheduling candidates and information on radio resources at the beginning of each slot.
2. The resource allocation position is selected based on the available frequency resources. The strategy is selected through the NRCellDU.pdschStartPrbStrategy attribute for PDSCH, and the NRCellDU.puschStartPrbStrategy attribute for PUSCH.
3. If resources are available, the available PRBs or Resource Block Groups (RBGs) are allocated sequentially to the UE. Note: If resources are not available, the scheduling process for the current slot is completed.

## 3.1 Available Strategies for Start PRB

Predefined strategy settings are available on the

NRCellDU.pdschStartPrbStrategy and

NRCellDU.puschStartPrbStrategy attributes.

| RANDOM_START_WITHIN_BAND     | Frequency resource allocation starts from a random RBG for PDSCH scheduling.(1) This is the default value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| RANDOM_START_WITHIN_BAND     | For PUSCH scheduling, this strategy is used when a smaller part of                                 the bandwidth is required to be allocated in the slot. In this case,                                 the frequency resource allocation starts at a random PRB. If a                                 greater part of the bandwidth is required to be allocated, the                                 frequency resource allocation from the high or the low frequency                                 edge is used in the slot instead.  This is the default value. |

# 4 Network Impact of Minimum Inter-Cell Interference Scheduling

With Minimum Inter-Cell Interference Scheduling, cell interference is distributed more

evenly over the whole bandwidth.

Capacity and Performance

Inter-cell interference is minimized by using different PRB and Resource Block Group

(RBG) start strategies in uplink and downlink.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Minimum Inter-Cell Interference Scheduling

Minimum Inter-Cell Interference Scheduling is associated with parameters of PRB strategy

selection.

Table 3   Parameters

| Parameter                      | Type       | Description          |
|--------------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| NRCellDU.pdschStartPrbStrategy | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| NRCellDU.puschStartPrbStrategy | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of Minimum Inter-Cell Interference Scheduling

The Minimum Inter-Cell Interference Scheduling feature has no associated KPIs, counters,

or events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
