Summary

This feature uses traffic load prediction to dynamically adjust the power amplifier VDD of

radio units, which increases energy efficiency without affecting coverage and

throughput.

This feature has the following benefits:

- Decreased energy consumption
- Decreased cost of operation
- Decreased radio unit temperature
- Compatibility with other power saving features

# 2 Dependencies of Quasi-Dynamic Power Amplifier VDD Adjustment

This feature is supported on Massive MIMO radio units.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

This feature is supported on the following radio units:

- AIR 3227, except B78W
- AIR 3239 B78C
- AIR 3278 B78K
- AIR 6449 B41
- AIR 6454 B41K

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Quasi-Dynamic Power Amplifier VDD Adjustment

This feature uses signal quality measurement to adjust the power amplifier voltage

drain of radio units.

Operational Process

1. The radio unit uses the transmitter observation receiver to measure signal quality at the power amplifier.
2. Based on the measured signal quality, the radio unit adjusts the power amplifier VDD through the DC converter. Note: The amount of voltage drain adjustment is based on the antenna branch with the lowest signal quality.
3. The energy efficiency of the power amplifier increases.
4. The overall energy efficiency of the radio unit increases.

# 4 Network Impact of Quasi-Dynamic Power Amplifier VDD Adjustment

The implementation of the feature has no impact on the network.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Quasi-Dynamic Power Amplifier VDD Adjustment

This feature has no configuration parameters.

# 6 Performance of Quasi-Dynamic Power Amplifier VDD Adjustment

This feature decreases the value of the

EnergyMeasurement.pmEnergyConsumption PM counter.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators.

Counters

The energy efficiency gains are observable through the decreased value of the

EnergyMeasurement.pmEnergyConsumption PM counter.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
