# 1 Port-Based Authentication Overview

Port-Based Authentication is a way of authenticating one or several cascaded Baseband

Radio Nodes that request connection to the transport network. The nodes are authenticated

through an 802.1X Authenticator connected to an Authentication Server.

Summary

The 802.1X Supplicant function enables the authentication towards an external Authenticator.

The Baseband Radio Node works as 802.1X Supplicant on transport network ports for

autointegration and also for normal operation.

The 802.1X Authenticator function enables the authentication of cascaded Baseband Radio Nodes

or other site equipments. In this case, the first authenticated Baseband Radio Node

acts as Authenticator of a directly connected Supplicant.

The Port-Based Authentication feature provides authentication, but no encryption or

authentication of user data. The feature can be used together with IPsec, or without

IPsec as well.

# 2 Dependencies of Port-Based Authentication

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

The Baseband Radio Node must be directly connected with LAN (fiber optic or cable) to

an 802.1X Authenticator.

Limitations

Port-Based Authentication feature has the following limitations:

- LAG is not supported
- Elastic RAN is not supported
- The feature is supported only for Transport Network ports.
- One Supplicant per Baseband Radio Node is supported.
- One Authenticator per Baseband Radio Node is supported.

Network Requirements

An Authentication Server must be installed in the secure network, and due to the

requirements of the Authenticator function, it must be RADIUS capable. The

Authentication Server must support TLS 1.2.

A 802.1X enabled Authenticator is required for the Supplicant function.

The external Authenticator must support multiple host mode. Multiple host mode

enables that when a Supplicant is authenticated, all traffic is allowed on the

corresponding Authenticator port, irrespectively of source and destination MAC

address and VLAN.

# 3 Feature Operation of Port-Based Authentication

802.1X authentication involves three parties: a Supplicant, an Authenticator and an

Authentication Server.

A Supplicant is an entity at one end of a point-to-point LAN segment that requests

authentication by an Authenticator attached to the other end of that link.

The 802.1X Authenticator is directly connected to the Supplicant on the same LAN segment.

The Authenticator forwards the authentication request of the Supplicant towards the

Authentication Server.

The Authentication Server provides authentication service to the Authenticator. This

service determines, from the credentials provided by the Supplicant, whether the

Supplicant is authorized to access the services provided by the secure system in which

the Authenticator resides. This includes the possibility of setting a whitelist

authentication policy on the Authentication Server, based on EAPOL identity, set with

the following value: &lt;node serial

number&gt;.ericsson.com.

The Port-Based Authentication feature includes the Supplicant function and the

Authenticator function running on the Baseband Radio Node. The function must be enabled

for each physical port separately.

The Baseband Radio Node Supplicant and the Authentication Server communicate using the

EAP-TLS protocol.

The Baseband Radio Node Supplicant and Authenticator communicate using the EAPoL

protocol.

The Baseband Radio Node Authenticator and the Authentication Server communicate using the

EAPoR protocol.

At autointegration the pre-installed Vendor Credentials are used for authentication of

the Baseband Radio Node Supplicant. After the autointegration phase, Node Credentials

from a Certificate Authority are used. If Node Credentials or trusted certificates are

not available, then the Supplicant is restarted again with Vendor Credentials. The CRL

is checked at initial authentication, to make sure the certificate is not revoked.

The Baseband Radio Node Authenticator enables the connection of cascaded Baseband Radio Nodes and other site equipment. The Baseband Radio Node is first authenticated as a Supplicant on one port, and then it acts an Authenticator on one or several other ports.

If Baseband Radio Nodes are already installed, all nodes in the cascaded chain must

support 802.1X authentication. If a node does not support 802.1X Authenticator

function, the OAM connectivity is blocked. In MoShell backup and restore management

(BRM) failsafe backup is recommended before adding the Authenticator function.

Operational Process for the Supplicant Function

1. The Baseband Radio Node port towards the secure network is configured as an 802.1X Supplicant. The Baseband Radio Node initiates or responds to the authentication process using Node Credentials over EAPoL.
2. The 802.1X Authenticator forwards the request to the Authentication Server using the EAPoR protocol. The Authenticator can be a Baseband Radio Node Authenticator, or an external Authenticator.
3. The Baseband Radio Node becomes authenticated and the ports on the node and on the Authenticator open up for traffic.
4. The Baseband Radio Node can now access the secure network.

Operational Process for the Authenticator Function

1. The Baseband Radio Node port towards the Supplicant is configured as an 802.1X Authenticator. The Supplicant initiates the authentication process using EAPoL.The Supplicant can be a Baseband Radio Node or an external supplicant.
2. The Baseband Radio Node Authenticator forwards the request to the Authentication Server using the EAPoR protocol.
3. The Supplicant becomes authenticated and the ports on the Supplicant and on the Authenticator open up for traffic.
4. The Supplicant can now access the secure network.

## 3.1 Zero Touch Autointegration with Port-Based Authentication

The following prerequisites need to be considered:

- The Baseband Radio Node must support autointegration with Port-Based Authentication.
- The Baseband Radio Node is directly connected to the 802.1X Authenticator.
- Authentication Server is installed and is accessible in the secure network.
- Node Credentials are installed on the Authentication Server.
- List of trusted Vendor Credentials and Node Credentials are available and are installed as trusted anchors on the Authentication Server.
- Configuration files to be installed on the Baseband Radio Node that support 802.1X Authentication, are part of the ENM, Auto Provision project.

Configure zero touch autointegration with port-based authentication as follows:

1. The Network Loader on the Baseband Radio Node initiates the authentication process, using Vendor Credentials, and EAP-TLS.
2. The 802.1X Authenticator communicates with the Authentication Server using the RADIUS protocol.
3. The Authentication Server recognizes the Vendor Credential. Then the port on the 802.1X Authenticator gets authenticated and opens up for traffic. The Baseband Radio Node can now access the trusted network.
4. The Network Loader performs legacy zero-touch autointegration, including the download of the Upgrade Package.
5. The Baseband Radio Node performs reboot, and starts up on the Upgrade Package.
6. The Baseband Radio Node authenticates itself by using Vendor Credentials.
7. The Baseband Radio Node downloads 802 Certificate from the CA using CMPv2. Then the 802 Certificate is enrolled on the Baseband Radio Node.
8. The Baseband Radio Node re-authenticates itself using the 802 Certificate.

## 3.2 Link Failure with Port-Based Authentication

In case of a link break between the Baseband Radio Node and the 802.1X Authenticator,

the following is expected:

1. The 802.1X Authenticator sets its previously authenticated port to unauthorized state. All traffic, except EAPoL, is discarded.
2. When the link break is over, the Baseband Radio Node initiates a new authentication process towards the 802.1X Authenticator and the Authentication server.
3. After successful authentication, the 802.1X Authenticator sets its respective port to authorized state again.

# 4 Network Impact of Port-Based Authentication

The Port-Based

Authentication feature affects recovery time after restarts and requires an Authentication

Server.

Capacity and Performance

The Port-Based Authentication feature increases time for traffic recovery after

restarts and reconfiguration.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

The Baseband Radio Node must be directly connected using cable or fiber optic to an

802.1X Authenticator. Authenticator is to be configured to support 802.1X

Authenticator function, used by a Supplicant, irrespectively of source and

destination MAC address or VLAN.

An Authentication Server must be installed in the secure network. Authentication

Server must be configured to enable EAP-TLS port authentication. It must accept

Ericsson certificates, used for Vendor Credential signing. Authenticator Server must

be RADIUS capable, so the Authenticator can connect to it through EAPoR.

# 5 Parameters for Port-Based Authentication

The Port-Based Authentication

feature introduces the Dot1xSupplicant,

Dot1xAuthenticatorPort and AuthenticationServer MO

classes and updates the EthernetPort MO class.

# 6 Performance of Port-Based Authentication

KPIs

This feature has no associated KPIs.

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
