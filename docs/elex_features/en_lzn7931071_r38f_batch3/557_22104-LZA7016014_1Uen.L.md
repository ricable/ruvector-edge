# 1 MACsec Overview

The feature is introduced on eCPRI links to achieve high-level security for user

traffic.

| Feature Name           | MACsec                                                  | MACsec                                                  |

Summary

The feature secures the user traffic of eCPRI link between a Baseband unit and radio unit

using MACsec. Only point-to-point links can be secured using this feature.

The operator has the option to enable or disable MACsec on node level or link level. The

MACsec feature is disabled by default.

The feature maximizes the provided security level by selecting the highest available level of

security services and the strongest available level of cipher function. This is

based on both the hardware capabilities and operator-configurable preferences.

# 2 Dependencies of MACsec

The feature can be activated on all Baseband units and eCPRI capable radios. However,

security services are only provided on certain units.

Features

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

The feature provides security services only with following units, where MACsec

hardware acceleration is available and it is enabled from software:

- Baseband 6641
- Baseband 6648
- Radio Processor 6337
- Radio Processor 6347
- AIR 3239

Hardware

acceleration is not limited to these units. However, only the units listed above

support the full functionality of the

feature.

Limitations

MACsec signaling is not compliant

with the

IEEE802.1X

MKA protocol, Ericsson proprietary EMKA (Ericsson MACsec Key Agreement)

protocol is

used,

running

over TLS.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of MACsec

The feature provides the capability to secure the user traffic of eCPRI link between a

Baseband unit and radio unit using MACsec. Only point-to-point links can be secured using

this feature.

The feature allows security configuration for all or for individual

RiLink MOs. Only user traffic is secured. Management and

synchronization traffic is not secured by MACsec.

The MACsec feature supports GCM-AES-128 and GCM-AES-256 ciphers.

For more details about MACsec configuration, see Manage MACsec.

# 4 Network Impact of MACsec

The feature

increases system restart and cell setup time. The feature also adds extra latency and

latency variation to eCPRI user plane traffic.

Capacity and Performance

The feature

adds

negligible extra latency and latency variation to eCPRI user plane traffic

because

of

added

encryption and decryption.

The

feature affects the additional MACsec configuration of RiLink MOs

in the following way:

- Increased system restart time by a few seconds
- Increased cell setup times, both initial and after link-disturbances, by a few seconds

Interfaces

The feature targets only the user plane traffic on the

eCPRI-based

Ethernet fronthaul point-to-point link between the

MACsec-capable

Baseband

units and radio units.

An Ericsson-proprietary

EMKA

is used for key management instead of

IEEE802.1X

MKA.

Other Network Elements

This feature requires upgrades on the following network elements:

- AIR 3239 and Baseband software must be upgraded to the latest version that includes MACsec software support.
- ENM must be upgraded to 22.1 version in order to enable, operate, and monitor this feature.

# 5 Parameters for MACsec

This feature introduces MOM attributes.

Table 1   Parameters

| Parameter               | Type       | Description          |
|-------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| Transport.macSecProfile | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| Transport.macSecCp      | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| Transport.macSecUcp     | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| Transport.macSecCa      | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of MACsec

This feature has no associated KPIs, counters, or events.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Counters

This feature has no directly associated counters.

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.
