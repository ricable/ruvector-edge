# 1 Enhanced Beam Management High-Band Overview

The feature provides additional optimization for beam management to improve performance

and robustness.

Summary

The feature introduces the following functions:

- CSI-RS transmission optimization
- Advanced P2/gNodeB beam tracking
- Coverage-optimized CSI reporting

In addition, the feature allows for measurement adaptation between the gNodeB and the UE with the help of specific radio types. The

use of the feature is supported on all carriers.

For the detailed description of beamforming procedures, see the section on beam

management in Scheduler High-Band.

CSI-RS Transmission Optimization

The feature optimizes the following characteristics for beam management to provide better

performance:

- One-slot CSI-RS transmission
- The use of downlink slots for improved PDSCH transmission
- The use of empty symbols on SCells, overlapping CSI-RS symbols on PCell for improved PDSCH scheduling

Advanced P2/gNodeB Beam Tracking

Switching to another wide beam can be delayed if the

CSI-RS-based RSRP measurements of the narrow beams within the new wide beam are

unavailable. The delay can result in radio condition degradation. The degradation is

reduced by including neighboring narrow beams from other wide beams in the

CSI-RS-based RSRP measurement on the current wide beam, and using the RSRP values of

neighboring narrow beams as a trigger to switch to the new wide beam. This means

that switching to the new wide beam occurs before new CSI-RS-based RSRP measurements

of all narrow beams in the new wide beam are made.

Coverage-Optimized CSI Reporting

Uplink data is generally scheduled in the same slot as the CSI report. Poor uplink conditions

are indicated by a failed CSI report. In such cases, beam management robustness is

prioritized over uplink data transmission, while uplink data throughput is affected

minimally. As a result, when gNodeB beam tracking occurs in

poor uplink conditions, uplink data scheduling is not multiplexed with the CSI

report. When gNodeB beam tracking fails, 11- or 12-symbol

PUSCH slots are used for scheduling to increase coverage gain.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Enhanced Beam Management High-Band

The feature enhances the beam tracking procedure for improved beam

management.

Operational Process

CSI-RS transmission optimization and coverage-optimized CSI reporting have different

operational characteristics.

CSI-RS Transmission Optimization

In the course of beam tracking, the following elements are used:

- SSB measurement report to find the best wide beam
- CSI-RS symbols and CSI reports to find the best narrow beam

Measurement adaptation between the gNodeB and the UE is

performed on the basis of the configured radio type. In case of some radio types,

CSI-RS symbols for beam tracking are transmitted in one slot instead of two slots.

In this way, an entire PDSCH slot is freed. In addition, previously unused OFDM

symbols can be scheduled in CSI-RS slots for PDSCH. The narrow beam CSI-RS symbols

are scheduled in the same dowlink slot, together with PDSCH data. All radio types

support the scheduling of PDSCH data in CSI-RS slots.

The following radio types and configurations support single-slot CSI-RS

transmission:

- AIR 1281 (Configuration Mode 1)
- AIR 5121

A number of radio types allow for

10 or

12 configured CSI-RS symbols. In such cases, the best narrow beam

is acquired

from each

of two configured CSI-RS resource sets. In case of radio types

allowing for six or seven CSI-RS symbols, a single CSI-RS resource set is configured

to report the best and the second best narrow beam. In both cases, there can be OFDM

symbols which do not overlap with CSI-RS symbols in the slot. These OFDM symbols are

used for PDSCH scheduling in Primary Cells and all available Secondary Cells. All

symbols in the CSI-RS slots not used for reference symbols (CSI-RS) are used for

PDSCH on both PCell and SCell traffic.

Coverage-Optimized CSI Reporting

If the last decoding attempt of CSI reports fails, the next beam tracking events

occur without data multiplexing. In such cases, only 11 or 12 symbols are used in

the slots for PUSCH. Beam tracking events are repeated until a valid CSI report is

received. After a valid CSI report is received, beam tracking procedures and uplink

data scheduling is restarted and normal operation follows.

# 4 Network Impact of Enhanced Beam Management High Band

The feature provides beam configuration options that allow for the prioritization of

robustness and enhance performance.

Capacity and Performance

The feature allows for increased coverage gain by disabling uplink data scheduling

during gNodeB beam tracking. In this way, beam management

robustness is prioritized. Performance is increased by the feature in the following

ways:

- For certain radio types and configurations, CSI-RS symbols for beam tracking are scheduled in a single slot only, freeing an entire slot for PDSCH.
- Unused OFDM symbols in downlink CSI-RS slots are used for downlink scheduling.
- Empty symbols on SCells, overlapping CSI-RS symbols on PCell are used for improved PDSCH scheduling.

In addition, advanced P2/gNodeB beam tracking

can decrease the delay in wide beam switching when the UE moves across wide beam

borders.

Interfaces

No impact.

Other Network Elements

No impact.

# 5 Parameters for Enhanced Beam Management High-Band

The feature is affected by a number of attributes related to beam

management.

Table 2   Parameters

| Parameter                              | Type     | Description          |
|----------------------------------------|----------|----------------------|
| NRCellDU.pmRadioNarrowBeamAcqTimeDistr | Affected | See MOM description. |
| Beam.beamId                            | Affected | See MOM description. |
| Beam.ssbPhysicalIndex                  | Affected | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of Enhanced Beam Management High-Band

The feature is related to one KPI and a number of counters monitoring beam management

configuration.

KPIs

Depending on the number of attached UEs and traffic shape, the increase in the

NRCellDU.pmPdschSchedActivity counter can decrease the

Normalized Average DL MAC Cell Throughput Considering Traffic KPI. This decrease

occurs if the traffic volume is not increased. If the attached UEs have full buffer

in the downlink, the downlink MAC volume increases with this feature. The impact and

benefits of the feature become visible with the increase in the number of attached

UEs. One attached UE cannot provide optimal visibility of the feature benefits.

Equation 1   Average Downlink MAC Cell Throughput

Counters

The feature is related to the following counters:

- NRCellDU.pmPdschSchedActivity
- NRCellDU.pmRadioBeamSwitchSuccMacCe
- NRCellDU.pmRadioBeamSwitchSucc
- NRCellDU.pmRadioNarrowBeamAcqTimeDistr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioServingBeamDlDistr
- NRCellDU.pmRadioSsbBeamSwitch
- Beam.pmRadioSsbRsrpDistr
- Beam.pmRadioSsbSinrPuschDistr
- Beam.pmRadioSsbSinrPucchF0Distr
- Beam.pmRadioSsbSinrPucchF2Distr

The NRCellDU.pmPdschSchedActivity counter increases in some

traffic deployments, as more PDSCH slots are available for downlink data

scheduling.

The

NRCellDU.pmRadioServingBeamDlDistr counter can be used to

monitor

SBB

beam utilization and

to

check beam utilization. If beam utilization is low,

the

tilt or direction of the radio unit can be changed.

For more information on beam indexes, see Beam Mapping in

Physical Layer High-Band.

Events

The feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Feature Change History

This section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the

network.

## 8.1 21.Q1: Advanced P2/gNodeB Beam Tracking

The feature enhancement allows for immediate switching to the new best neighboring

wide beam based on RSRP measurements of the current beam. In this way, potential delay in

switching because of unavailable RSRP measurements on the new wide beam can be

avoided.

| Feature Name:           | Enhanced Beam Management High-Band   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5217                         |
| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package                      |
| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002                         |
| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                  |
| Access Type:            | NR                                   |

During beam tracking, the UE can move from one wide beam to another.

Switching to another wide beam only occurs if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The SSB-based RSRP measurement of the new wide beam is higher than the sum of the SSB-based RSRP of the current wide beam and a predefined wide beam threshold. Note: If this condition is not fulfilled, CSI-RS-based RSRP measurements are not performed for the narrow beams that belong to another wide beam. This can cause delay in switching to the new wide beam.
- The CSI-RS-based RSRP measurement of a narrow beam within the new wide beam is higher than the sum of the CSI-RS-based RSRP of the current narrow beam and a predefined narrow beam threshold.

The enhancement ensures that CSI-RS-based RSRP measurements are always performed on the

closest neighboring narrow beams, regardless of the wide beam RSRP levels and regardless

of which wide beam the neighboring narrow beam is mapped to. This way, if CSI-RS-based

RSRP measurements are not performed for the narrow beams that belong to another wide

beam, delay in wide beam switching can be avoided.

Benefits

The enhancement prevents the degradation of radio conditions caused by the possible

delay in wide beam switching.

Capacity and Performance

The enhancement maintains the optimal level of uplink and downlink throughput in the

course of switching to the new best wide beam.
