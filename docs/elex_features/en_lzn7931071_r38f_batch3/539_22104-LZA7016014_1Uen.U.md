# 1 Security Layer for SCTP Overview

The feature provides DTLS for SCTP over the Xn-C and NG-C interfaces. This is an

optional security feature that can be enabled for each SCTP endpoint.

Summary

This feature introduces the option to configure the gNodeB for protecting the Xn-C and NG-C

interfaces through DTLS over SCTP.

The feature has the following benefits:

- DTLS protection of the Xn-C and NG-C interfaces
- Interoperability with relevant 3GPP recommendations

# 2 Dependencies of Security Layer for SCTP

This feature has no

dependencies.

Feature Dependencies

There are no dependencies to other features.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirement.

Limitations

No known limitations.

Network Requirements

No specific network requirements.

# 3 Feature Operation of Security Layer for SCTP

The feature provides DTLS protection for SCTP over the Xn-C and NG-C interfaces in

forced or preferred mode.

The SctpEndpoint MO attributes must be manually configured to enable

the feature.

Forced Protection Operational Process

When DTLS protection is forced, it is only possible to connect peers that support the

relevant standards and have valid certificates.

There is a DTLS handshake with certificates prior encryption of data over the

interface. DTLS is negotiated after the association and authenticated chunks are

negotiated, before any traffic is sent. If authenticated chunks or DTLS negotiation

fails, the system aborts the association.

Preferred Protection Operational Process

When DTLS protection is preferred, it is possible to connect peers that have valid

support for the relevant standards. Attempts to connect to peers that do not support

DTLS/SCTP protection is accepted only if those peers do not negotiate authenticated

chunks for data chunk type.

There is a DTLS handshake with certificates prior encryption of data over the

interface. DTLS is negotiated after the association and authenticated chunks are

negotiated, before any traffic is sent.

# 4 Network Impact of Security Layer for SCTP

This feature is applicable to the Xn-C and NG-C

interfaces.

Capacity and Performance

No

impact.

Interfaces

The feature provides DTLS for SCTP over the Xn-C and NG-C interfaces.

Other Network Elements

ENM version

# 5 Parameters for Security Layer for SCTP

The Security Layer for SCTP feature introduces new MOM

attributes.

Table 1   Parameters

| Parameter                                | Type       | Description          |
|------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| Dtls.cipherFilter                        | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| Dtls.dtlsId                              | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| Dtls.enabledCiphers                      | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| Dtls.supportedProtocolVersion            | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| Dtls.reservedBy                          | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| Dtls.supportedCiphers                    | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| Dtls.selectedProtocolVersion             | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| SctpAssociation.associationSecurityState | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| SctpEndpoint.dtls                        | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| SctpEndpoint.dtlsSctpSecurityMode        | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| SctpEndpoint.dtlsTrustCategory           | Introduced | See MOM description. |
| SctpEndpoint.dtlsNodeCredential          | Introduced | See MOM description. |

# 6 Performance of Security Layer for SCTP

This feature introduces one new

counter.

KPIs

This feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators.

Counters

- SctpEndpoint.sctpEndpointDtlsNegotiationFailed

Events

This feature has no associated events.

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Security Layer for SCTP

The introduced MOM attributes are used to enable the operation of this

feature.

The attribute SctpEndpoint.dtlsSctpSecurityMode is used to enable the

security function for the SCTP endpoint.

The feature has two possible modes: preferred and forced. Preferred mode can be used when

the network is being upgraded with this functionality, to avoid issues during the phase

where some nodes support DTLS and some do not. The default setting when nodes support

DTLS is forced, where DTLS security function must be used for the SCTP endpoint. The

attributes SctpEndpoint.dtlsNodeCredential and

SctpEndpoint.dtlsTrustCategory are used to reference the

certificates being used at the DTLS handshake. The attribute

SctpEndpoint.dtls is used to reference the configured cipher

suite to be used.

To use preferred mode, set the SctpEndpoint.dtlsSctpSecurityMode

attribute to preferred. To use forced mode, set the

SctpEndpoint.dtlsSctpSecurityMode attribute to

forced.

It is recommended to set the local port number for the SCTP endpoint to the following

values:

- 38422 for Xn interface
- 38412 for NG interface
