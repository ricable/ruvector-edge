# 3 Feature Operation of In-Service Performance Excellence

The In-Service Performance Excellence feature improves robustness through several

functions.

The aim of the feature is to reduce service downtime with focus on the following

mechanisms:

| System restarts                  |    | The function enables optimized restart sequences and good control of the                         restart domains, for example individual Radio Access Technology, to reach                         service availability as fast as possible. For example:  reduced degradation by detecting misalignments on the Baseband                                     Radio Node caused by incorrect activation of the Node Group                                     Synchronization (NGS) function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                  |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Restart alerts                   |    | Whenever a system or radio restart occurs, an alert is sent from the Baseband                         Radio Node. The operator gets a notification that a restart has occurred.                         The notification includes additional information on for example:  Restart time     Restart category     Restart type     Hardware product name     Hardware product number     Hardware product R-state     Hardware serial number     Software product R-state     Software product number      The alerts do not require any user intervention, but the operator can choose                         to filter out and suppress unwanted notifications. This can increase the                         relevance of the received notifications and reduce the number of alarms and                         alerts sent from the Baseband Radio Node. |
|                                  |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Automatic recoveries             |    | Whenever a fault occurs, the system is trying to recover the failed resource                         unless it is evaluated as a non-recoverable problem that requires operator                         intervention. For example:  detection of suspected sleeping cells based on the radio carrier                                     power levels, and the cell resetup triggered automatically as a                                     recovery mechanism.      If a fault results in service impact and all recovery attempts in escalation                         staircase fails to restore service, an automatic recovery function makes                         program restarts every six hours. These restarts are performed automatically                         as long as the fault exists, until service is restored.                     |

| Automatic mitigation of problems |    | System is trying to keep the service operational with as minimal degradation                         as possible by using alternative resources or network capabilities. At the                         same time, the system is clearly indicating a fault to the operator so they                         can plan and execute corrective actions. For example:  detection of vulnerable NTP server source. If detected, RAN node                                     stops obtaining time and date information from the NTP server                                     and keeps using its internal system time and date. A related                                     alarm is also raised.                                                                                                                                                             |

# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features

Non-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be

deactivated.

While license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features

are activated automatically during node integration. They also do not

have

a software license key associated, which means that they have no

entries in the LKF that is installed on the node.

In some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured

manually or have some of

their

subfunctions enabled to work properly.

Summary and Benefits

This improvement introduces radio unit restart notification for Baseband Radio Node.

The operator is notified with an alert when radio unit has been restarted for any

reason. Additional information parameter within alert shows if radio restart is

caused by external problem (for example, loss of power), ordered by operator, or

automatically initiated by the system software itself. Information about restart

time, restart category and restart type is provided as well.

The single alert does not require operator intervention, while more information about

the restart can be collected through the availability log. However, if an unexpected

or high rate of radio restarts is seen on node or network level, Ericsson Support

should be contacted (a Customer Support Request including Data collection, see Data Collection Guideline).

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The alert is suppressed on the node by default. The user activates alert by setting

isNotified attribute to NOTIFIED

on the FmAlarmType MO instance created for Radio

Restart Alert.

For more information, see  Radio Restart Alert and Manage Faults.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

The following radio types are supported:

- Radio Group 4b
- Radio Group 6 (AIR 1641, AIR 3246, IRU, and Radio Dots excluded)
- Radio Group 7a
- Radio Group 8

Summary and Benefits

The feature enhancement provides the following benefit:

- An advanced filter capability is introduced to allow the user to define precise conditions that examine variable contents of alarm or alert fields. These conditions decide if a notification is sent out to ENM or suppressed.

The introduced mechanism is a general Fault Management function. The function is

applicable for all alarms and alerts generated in the node. This includes all Radio

Access Technologies deployed in the node.

Suppressed alarms and alerts are still logged on the node in Alarm Log and Alert

Log.

The FmAlarm MO is instantiated for all active alarms whether they

have been notified or not.

Capacity and Performance

No impact.

Operation

The MOM is modified by introducing the following MO classes:

- FmFilterModel
- FmFilter

Decisions to notify or suppress a given notification are taken based on the variable

content of the notification. There already exists a notification filtering which

relies on the FmAlarmType.isNotified attribute.

The FmAlarm:isNotified attribute indicates if an alarm or alert is

notified or suppressed when it is raised. This attribute is visible in Alarm Log,

Alert Log, and instances of FmAlarm for active alarms.

Alarms with either perceived severity or configured severity set to

CRITICAL cannot be suppressed.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.

| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                           |

Summary and Benefits

This feature enhancement has the following benefits:

- Improved observability of NR cell availability
- Risk reduction of KPI misunderstanding caused by restart on lower level

Capacity and Performance

Cell service events on NRCellDU MO class indicate the following

cases:

- The cell is in service
- The cell is partially out of service
- The cell is out of service

The cell service events are logged in the availability log when a service

change occurs in the NRCellDU MO class.

Service events on NRCellDU MO level can be used to measure cell

downtime at restart on lower level, when the Partial Cell Availability for gNodeB

Cell KPI continues to be stepped. This can occur, for example, during an NR Baseband

reset, when the downtime for reset is higher than the downtime for higher level of

restart.

Operation

No impact.

Interfaces

No impact.

Hardware

No specific hardware requirements.
