The\n\nadjustment depends on the number of layers that are transmitted. EIRP limitation scales\n\nwith the carrier bandwidth.\n\nAfter PMI feedback, if the EIRP of the PDSCH is greater than the allowed EIRP threshold,\n\nthe system reduces the power of the PDSCH for each UE. The feature adaptively applies\n\ndifferent backoff values to the PDSCH based on the scheduled UEs in each TTI.\n\n# 4 Network Impact of Adaptive Power Adjustment for EIRP Limit\n\nThe feature can boost\n\nPDSCH performance and retain the coverage of the downlink common channel.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nCompared to when the value of the\n\nNRSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower attribute is reduced to\n\nsatisfy the EIRP requirements, the feature boosts PDSCH performance and retains the\n\ncoverage of the downlink common channels.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.\n\n# 5 Parameters for Adaptive Power Adjustment for EIRP Limit\n\nThe feature introduces\n\nattributes for EIRP limitation and requires an attribute to be configured.\n\nTable 3   Parameters\n\n| Parameter                                   | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| NRSectorCarrier.maxAllowedEirpPsd           | Introduced | See MOM description.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| NRSectorCarrier.muEirpPmiDistBasedThreshold | Introduced | See MOM description.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| NRSectorCarrier.configuredMaxTxPower        | Affecting  | The feature only reduces power on PDSCH.

Users can be multiplexed and scheduled efficiently in time, using spectral and\n\nhardware resources to optimize user throughput and cell capacity. The feature\n\nperforms data transmission on the basis of predefined TDD patterns. Selective data\n\ntransmission is handled by the feature based on such transmission patterns, and\n\ndynamic slot use.\n\nScheduling, also referred to as DRA, is done dynamically for every slot. For every upcoming\n\nslot, the Scheduler High-Band feature determines which users are assigned radio\n\ninterface and radio node resources.\n\nThe feature provides resource assignment for downlink and uplink UE traffic for multiple\n\ncarriers and multiple users, depending on the activated features and hardware\n\ncapabilities.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nInformation and topics related to this feature can be found in the following\n\ndocumentation:\n\n- 3GPP v15.4\n- 3GPP TS38. 211; NR Physical Channels and Modulation\n- 3GPP TS38. 212; NR Multiplexing and Channel Coding\n- 3GPP TS38. 213; NR Physical Layer Procedures for Control\n- 3GPP TS38. 214; NR Physical Layer Procedures for Data\n- 3GPP TS38. 321; NR Medium Access Control (MAC) Protocol Specification\n\n# 2 Dependencies of Scheduler High-Band\n\nThis feature is related to features providing coverage extension, dual connectivity,\n\nand priority-based scheduling mostly for High-Band. It is supported for both\n\nEN-DC- and NR-DC-configured UEs.\n\nTable 1   Feature Dependencies\n\n| Feature                                                                                                        | Relationship   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Closed-Loop Power Control High-Band (FAJ                                 121 5345)                             | Related        | The Closed-Loop Power Control High-Band feature provides dynamic UE                                 transmission power control on PUSCH.

If data is available on downlink data transmission, downlink scheduling candidates are sent to the Scheduler High-Band feature.\n2. Uplink scheduling candidates are sent to the Scheduler High-Band feature for every possible uplink slot with the assumption that UE has a full buffer of data.Note: The power headroom reports (PHR) of the UE are not considered during scheduling.\n3. At the beginning of each slot, the Scheduler High-Band feature receives scheduling candidates and information on radio resources.\n4. If resources are available and there are relevant downlink or uplink scheduling candidates, the Scheduler High-Band feature allocates an appropriate amount of resources to the UE. PRBs are allocated as scheduling elements to available slots.\n\n## 3.1 Periodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH in High-Band\n\nA Scheduling Request (SR) configuration consists of a set of PUCCH resources for\n\nScheduling Requests across different BWPs and cells. A Scheduling Request is used by the UE\n\nto request PUSCH resources for a new PUSCH transmission.\n\nIn NR, the Scheduling Request is configured on the logical channel level, not on the UE\n\nlevel as in LTE.\n\nWhen the UE has pending uplink data to transmit, it triggers a pending Scheduling\n\nRequest. The UE sends its pending Scheduling Request to the gNodeB in dedicated periodic\n\nSR PUCCH format 0 resources.\n\nThe dedicated periodic SR PUCCH resources are configured by the gNodeB through the RRC.\n\nThe UE is configured to transmit the Scheduling Request on the SR PUCCH resources up to\n\n64 times. It is possible that the UE fails to receive a scheduling grant despite the SR\n\nPUCCH transmissions. In such cases, the UE schedules the Scheduling Request on\n\nRACH.\n\nApart from transmitting the pending Scheduling Request on the periodic SR PUCCH resource,\n\nthe UE can also multiplex Scheduling Request information. Multiplexing occurs on a\n\nHARQ-ACK PUCCH resource, overlapping in time. In this case, the UE performs the\n\nfollowing events:\n\n- Multiplexes the Scheduling Request information into the HARQ-ACK information message.\n- Transmits the Scheduling Request information on the HARQ-ACK PUCCH resource.\n- Avoids transmission on the SR PUCCH resource.\n\nThe periodic SR PUCCH resource is set for four\n\nor eight slots depending\n\non\n\nthe\n\nTDD pattern. The gNodeB decodes the following types of PUCCH resources\n\nto retrieve the Scheduling Request information:\n\n- Periodic SR\n- HARQ-ACK\n\nThe periodic SR PUCCH resource has the following characteristics:\n\n- Supported for all High-Band patterns.\n- Potentially decreases the latency of devices using Connected Mode DRX (C-DRX).\n- It is decoded with dedicated periodic SR PUCCH resources.\n- The following specific RRC configuration parameters are provided to the UE: Periodicity Cyclic shift PRB\n\nThe periodic SR PUCCH resource can be multiplexed on aperiodic HARQ-ACK PUCCH resources.\n\nDifferent devices handle the periodic SR PUCCH resource differently, depending on their\n\ncapabilities. HARQ-ACK PUCCH resources constitute either one or two slots.\n\nService-adaptive SR periodicity configurations can reduce\n\nPUCCH decoding rate for non-time-critical services to prioritize PUCCH decoding on\n\nlatency-critical services.\n\nThe following counters are introduced for the measurement of the periodic SR PUCCH\n\nresource:\n\n- NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSrNote: It is possible that the UE fails to access the node by the Scheduling Request over PUCCH. In such cases, the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSr counter counts the number of received Scheduling Requests over RACH. With the Improved Periodic SR function, the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSr PM counter is updated to count the number of times an SR on RACH triggers RRC reconfiguration to restore normal scheduling. To maintain observability for the number of RRC reconfigurations on RACH for each C-RNTI, the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchSrResourcesRestoredDistr PM counter is introduced.\n- NRCellDU.pmMacPucchSrPuschGrantLatDistr\n- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlUnresUePucchSrGrant\n- NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchSrResourcesRestoredDistrNote: When the value of the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSr PM counter is abnormally high, the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchSrResourcesRestoredDistr counter can be checked to determine if this is caused by UE behavior or radio conditions.\n\nThe Periodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH function can affect the\n\nNRCellDU.pmRadioPuschTable1McsDistr counter.\n\nExisting\n\nscheduling serves a significant part of uplink traffic with MCS 0 when uplink traffic is\n\nlow. This occurs when the gNodeB preschedules UEs in the following conditions:\n\n- UEs inactive during beam management\n- UEs active immediately after data transmission in the downlink or in the uplink\n\nIn such cases, the gNodeB uses MCS 0, as it is not aware if the UE has pending\n\nuplink data to transmit. The Periodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH function allows\n\nnon-active UEs to be scheduled directly on the MCS most suitable for the UE, as the\n\ngNodeB is aware of its pending uplink data. In cells with good radio conditions, this\n\nresults in more pegs on higher MCSs in the\n\nNRCellDU.pmRadioPuschTable1McsDistr counter.\n\nThis function also affects the NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalMenb\n\ncounter. Physical restrictions over the air interface can prohibit the\n\ngNodeB from serving the UE with an uplink grant within the\n\nshort latency this function introduces. These physical restrictions can manifest in\n\nradio conditions that prevent RACH resources from reaching the gNodeB. In such cases, the gNodeB\n\nreleases the UE from SCG radio resources and pegs the\n\nNRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalMenb counter. After this, the UE can\n\nreattach to the network with normal handling.\n\nTo minimize impact on the NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalMenb counter due\n\nto feature activation, the settings recommended by Ericsson must be used for the above\n\nparameters, as frequently using MCG radio resources can cause unwanted drops. For more\n\ninformation, see RAN Parameter Recommendations List.\n\nIf the Coverage-Optimized Uplink Scheduling High-Band feature is active, the\n\nScheduling Request PUCCH resource allocation is moved to the inner region of the\n\nbandwidth to reduce MPR.\n\nRelated Information\n\nNR Service-Adaptive SR Periodicity High-Band for Public RAN\n\nNR Service-Adaptive SR Periodicity High-Band for Dedicated RAN\n\n## 3.2 Coverage-Adaptive SR Periodicity in High-Band\n\nSR periodicity is automatically configured based on radio conditions.\n\nThe number of abnormal UE releases is increased in High-Band at the edge of cells where\n\nradio conditions are poor. The coverage-adaptive SR periodicity for High-Band\n\nfunctionality allows the gNodeB to determine if a UE is in good or limited uplink radio\n\ncoverage based on the configured RSRP threshold and uplink SINR thresholds.\n\nAt secondary gNodeB addition or PSCell change, radio conditions are determined based on\n\nRSRP measurements and a configured initial RSRP threshold. The RSRP threshold is set\n\nusing the SrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg.covAdaptSrPStartRsrpThresh\n\nattribute.\n\nWhen the UE is in connected mode, the gNodeB continuously evaluates radio conditions\n\nbased on uplink SINR. The SINR thresholds used for estimating the channel conditions are\n\nconfigured using the\n\nSrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg.covAdaptSrPNrLowQualThresh and\n\nSrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg.covAdaptSrPNrQualHyst attributes.\n\nWhen the UE is in limited coverage, SR periodicity is configured to the maximum supported\n\nnumber of slots to prolong the SR requests on PUCCH. If the UE returns to better radio\n\nconditions, SR periodicity is set to the configured SR periodicity value.\n\nFor EN-DC and NR-DC deployments, the benefits from the functionality are seen only when\n\nSR periodicity is changed to a longer duration while the uplink leg is active on SCG. It\n\nis recommended to set the coverage-adaptive SR periodicity threshold value higher by at\n\nleast 3 dB than the uplink leg switch threshold.\n\nIt is recommended to set the\n\nSrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg.covAdaptSrPEnabled attribute to false\n\nwhen using NR standalone High-Band deployments.\n\n## 3.3 Scheduling Priority\n\nThe feature determines which UEs are assigned resources in each slot of each\n\ncell.\n\nScheduling is based on the scheduling weight attached to the PRBs. The user with the\n\nlonger scheduling delay is to be scheduled earlier. If\n\nthe Priority-Controlled Scheduling and NR Relative Priority Scheduling features are\n\nactivated, priority can be configured on a DRB level. As a result, the scheduling weight\n\nis a combination of the user DRB priority and waiting time.\n\nHARQ\n\nIn NR, HARQ has the following characteristics both in the downlink and in the\n\nuplink:\n\n| Asynchronous   |    | No predefined timing for retransmissions occurs.     The number of HARQ processes is explicitly indicated in                                         DCI.   |\n|----------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                |    |                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Adaptive       |    | HARQ retransmission requires an uplink grant or a downlink                             assignment.                                                          |\n\nHARQ ACK is sent on PUCCH.\n\nThe HARQ procedure is also used for Msg3 PUSCH. Msg3 HARQ has the following\n\ncharacteristics:\n\n- It triggers the UE to attempt Msg3 retransmission during the ra-ContentionResolutionTimer.\n- It is determined by DCI 0\\_0.\n\n## 3.4 Scheduling Channels\n\nThe feature uses different resources in the downlink and the uplink\n\nchannels.\n\nTable 2   Resources for Downlink and Uplink Scheduling\n\n| Direction   | Resources                                                            | Description                                                                                                       |\n|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Downlink    | PDSCH resources (PRBs and symbols)     PDCCH resources     CSI-RS(1) | Downlink scheduling resides entirely in the node.                                                                 |\n| Uplink      | PUSCH resources (PRBs and symbols)     PUCCH resources               | In the uplink, both the node and the UE are involved in the                                 scheduling procedure. |\n\n(1)\n\nCSI-RS is used for the TRS only\n\n## 3.5 Scheduling Algorithm for High-Band\n\nSummary\n\nIf the Priority-Controlled Scheduling and NR Relative\n\nPriority Scheduling features are activated, resource-fair scheduling is used with\n\nDRB priority. Multiple downlink and uplink scheduling candidates are sent\n\nto the Scheduler High-Band feature. In the downlink, scheduling candidates are based\n\non downlink buffer status. In the uplink, devices are scheduled either based on\n\nPUCCH SR, BSR, or prescheduling.\n\nThe scheduling rank corresponds to the number of layers using the same TDD or FDD\n\nresources. In High-Band, transmission ranks 1 and 2 are supported.\n\nLink Adaptation\n\nLink adaptation determines the amount of data that can be scheduled and the\n\nconditions of scheduling. Such conditions include, for example, the used MCS, the\n\nnumber of layers and precoding. Link adaptation occurs in each component carrier\n\nwhen carrier aggregation is used.\n\nDownlink decisions on the amount of scheduled data are based on reports from the UE.\n\nThese reports provide the gNodeB information on channel\n\nquality and suggested scheduling rank. The gNodeB schedules\n\na symbol containing CSI-RS and CSI-IM for measurements in the downlink and\n\ncorresponding resources for reporting in the uplink. In addition to the reported CQI\n\nand scheduling rank, the gNodeB also compensates for the\n\nHARQ NACK ratio. Compensation occurs on original transmissions when selecting the\n\nMCS.\n\nIn the uplink, decision on the number of layers, for UEs capable of\n\nUL MIMO, is based on the following information:\n\n- The rank reported by the UE, which is treated as an upper limitation\n- Measured SINR and SINR difference between the layers\n\nIn transition to single-layer transmissions, for UEs capable of UL MIMO, the\n\nSINR difference determines the layer to use.\n\nDecisions on the amount of scheduled data are based on the following information:\n\n- SINR measured on the used layer in single-layer transmissions\n- The average SINR over two layers, in two-layer transmissions\n\nAll SINR measurements occur on PUSCH DMRS on each layer.\n\nIf the Coverage-Optimized Uplink Scheduling High-Band feature is active,\n\nthe number of PRBs allocated to the link adaptation CSI reports is decreased. This\n\nensures better reception of the link adaptation CSI reports. In addition, inner PRB\n\nallocation is applied for PUSCH to reduce MPR. Inner PRB allocation for PUSCH takes\n\nplace when the number of scheduled PRBs is equal or less than one-third of the total\n\ncarrier bandwidth.\n\nScheduling Overlapping Symbols in SCells\n\nIn downlink slots, the CSI-RS and PDCCH symbols are often only transmitted on a\n\nsubset of the downlink carriers. The other carriers can instead be used to transmit\n\nPDSCH data.\n\nPDSCH data can only be transmitted to one UE for each slot, and the use of\n\noverlapping symbols depends on three use cases. Since only one beam direction, at\n\nthe same time, can be applied for carriers mapped to one PAAM segment different\n\nconstraint are applied according to use cases.\n\nThe following use cases are available for this function:\n\n- CSI-RS symbols for P2 Beam Tracking, with following constraints: Sector carriers at same PAAM segment as the cell carrying CSI-RS information cannot be used. CSI-RS and PDSCH cannot be scheduled to the same UE for this use case.\n- CSI-RS symbols for Link Adaptation, with following constraints Sector carriers at same PAAM segment as the PSCell carrying CSI-RS information cannot be used, unless CSI-RS and PDSCH are scheduled to the same UE.\n- PDCCH symbols for UL DCI, with following constraints Sector carriers at same PAAM segment as the Cell carrying UL DCI information cannot be used, unless PDCCH and PDSCH are scheduled to the same UE.\n\nUplink Component Aggregation\n\nUplink component aggregation allows the configuration of multiple PSCells and up to\n\ntwo SCells in the uplink. To configure up to three SCells in the uplink, carrier\n\naggregation with four component carriers must be supported. The bandwidth-dependent\n\nscheduling limits determine the maximum number of scheduled SCells in the\n\nuplink.\n\nDownlink Component Aggregation\n\nDownlink component aggregation allows for optimal downlink throughput and carrier\n\nuse. All downlink slots can use all carriers both for new data transmission and\n\nretransmission purposes. The same downlink scheduling priority is assigned to new\n\ndata transmissions and retransmissions. New data and retransmission data are\n\nco-scheduled with the following characteristics:\n\n- In the same slot\n- For the same UE candidate\n- On different carriers\n\nIn this way, the scheduling use of the number of used carriers can be\n\nincreased. Also, fair slot distribution can be secured among devices with pending\n\ndownlink data but different HARQ NACK or downlink transmission rates.\n\nDownlink component aggregation is supported with the available TDD patterns.\n\nNR RU Intelligent Temperature Handling\n\nThis function enables the radio unit to regulate the temperature pre-emptively. This\n\nallows the operation to continue even when the ambient temperature or the load\n\nexceeds operational limits.\n\nIf the radio unit detects that the internal temperature exceeds a threshold, it\n\nrequests the gNodeB to limit scheduling intensity\n\nin downlink. This limit is based on the temperature in the radio unit.\n\nThe NR RU Intelligent Temperature Handling function ensures that the high-band\n\nscheduler does not exceed the PDSCH resources provided by the radio unit. Traffic\n\nconditions can make the PDSCH slot use exceed the set maximum. In such cases, the\n\ngNodeB forcefully blanks, that is, delays the\n\nscheduling of some PDSCH slots. In this way, it conforms to the set limit. The\n\nNRCellDU.pmRadioPdschEmptySlotsForced PM counter is stepped\n\nfor each forcefully blanked slot.\n\nThe radio unit uses the blank slots to lower energy output. It utilizes the Micro\n\nSleep TX feature. Reduced energy consumption lowers the temperature of the radio\n\nunit over time.\n\n## 3.6 Beam Management\n\nThe Scheduler High-Band feature is involved in beam management for resource and\n\nreport scheduling.\n\nThere are three procedures for establishing a wide beam to track the best narrow beam.\n\nThese procedures are the following:\n\n- Beam establishment\n- gNodeB beam refinement and Advanced P2/gNodeB tracking\n- UE beam refinement and tracking\n\n| Procedure                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Beam establishment                                                  | SSB sweep and access through PRACH.

An                                 aperiodic CSI-RS beam sweep with a CSI report is used to find the                                 best narrow beam. An SSB measurement report is used to find best                                 wide beam (SSB beam). |\n| UE beam refinement and tracking                                     | The UE can use SSB, TRS or aperiodic CSI-RS in the currently used                                 beam to evaluate new UE beams.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n\nFigure 1   Example of Beam Refinement from Wide to Narrow Beam\n\nBeam Establishment\n\nThe SSB beam sweeps occur on wide beams. The UE measures the SSBs and selects the\n\nbest SSB beam. This SSB beam is used to send the random access preamble on the\n\nrandom access occasion that maps to the respective wide beams of the chosen SSB. The\n\nprocedure is also called beam acquisition.\n\nThe Downlink Power Boost for Initial Access High-Band can\n\nhelp with connection establishment. If this feature is active, the PDCCH power of\n\nthe following messages can be boosted:\n\n- Msg2\n- Msg3 retransmission grant\n- Msg4 grant\n- Initial P2 refinement\n\nThe PRBs of the PDSCH are moved to the center and the coverage of Msg2 can also\n\nbe boosted.\n\ngNodeB Beam Refinement and Advanced P2/gNodeB Tracking\n\nAfter the finalization of the random access procedure, beam refinement is triggered.\n\nCSI resources and CSI reports are scheduled, one for each narrow beam in the\n\nselected wide beam. The gNodeB sets the CSI\n\nrequest field to the aperiodic trigger state entry that corresponds to the selected\n\nwide beam. The narrow beam CSI resources can be distributed in the following\n\nways:\n\n- Split into two different resource sets scheduled in two consecutive downlink slots (12 CSI-RS symbols)\n- Scheduled in one resource set of a single slot (six or seven CSI-RS symbols)\n\nA corresponding CSI report is scheduled in the uplink, based on the selected\n\nnumber of CSI resource sets and containing the following elements:\n\n- One RSRP measurement result for each resource set in case of 12 CSI-RS symbols\n- Two RSRP measurement results for the single resource set in case of six or seven CSI-RS symbols\n\nThe number of used CSI-RS symbols determine the number of CSI-RS slots for beam\n\ntracking.\n\nTable 3   CSI-RS Slot Configuration\n\n| Number of CSI-RS Symbols   |   Number of Configured CSI-RS Slots |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| 12                         |                                   2 |\n| 6 or 7                     |                                   1 |\n\nThere can be OFDM symbols which do not overlap with CSI-RS symbols in the\n\nslot. These symbols are used for PDSCH scheduling in Primary Cells and all available\n\nSecondary Cells. Symbols on Secondary cells, overlapping CSI-RS symbols on Primary\n\ncell, are also used for PDSCH scheduling when possible as described in Scheduling Algorithm for High-Band.\n\nIn the course of beam refinement, a CSI-RS resource indicator (CRI) is delivered with the best RSRP measurement result of both reports.\n\nThe CRI with the best RSRP measurement result of both reports is used subsequently\n\nfor the following purposes in the given order:\n\n- Triggering a link adaptation measurement\n- Beginning data scheduling\n\nNarrow beam tracking is performed within the following beam configurations:\n\n- Current wide beam\n- Current wide beam including neighboring narrow beams of other wide beams\n- Another wide beam\n\nIn case of CSI resource and CSI report scheduling, the best SSB is measured.\n\nWhen a new best SSB is found, a CSI-RS narrow beam measurement is performed within\n\nthat SSB.\n\nThe SSB Power Boost feature can increase SSB\n\ntransmission power in High-Band. Increased SSB transmission power reduces the\n\nreceived power difference between wide and narrow beams. In this way, the SSB Power Boost feature can improve gNodeB\n\nbeam refinement.\n\nUE Beam Refinement and Tracking\n\nThe UE can perform beam refinement based on SSB and TRS. There are\n\nthree\n\nsymbols with DMRS\n\nin\n\nevery SSB period.\n\nDuring\n\nthis\n\ntime,\n\nthe UE can evaluate\n\nthree\n\nbeams. Aperiodic CSI-RS can be scheduled for the UE to perform UE beam\n\nrefinement.\n\n## 3.7 Measurement Gap Handling for Scheduler High-Band\n\nUEs can be configured with a measurement gap in NR-DC and NR standalone\n\ndeployments.\n\nIf the UE is configured with a measurement gap, the UE is not scheduled for downlink and\n\nuplink transmission during the measurement gap, except for the Random Access\n\nprocedure.\n\nIn an NR-DC configuration, the measurement gap on the Master Node is only forwarded to\n\nthe Secondary Node scheduler if the\n\nfollowing\n\nconditions apply:\n\n- A measurement gap is configured for all frequencies or High-Band frequencies.\n- The measurement gap configuration is changed.\n\nFor more information, see Measurement Gap-Aware NR Scheduling.\n\n# 4 Network Impact of Scheduler High-Band\n\nThe\n\nfeature ensures efficient resource assignment for UEs and reduces equipment heating by\n\ncontrolling energy output.\n\nCoverage\n\nThe scheduling of resources is based on prevailing channel condition and buffer\n\nstatus.\n\nScheduler Load Capacity\n\nFor more information on current capacity numbers, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR RAN.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nIf the gaps between downlink traffic bursts are not enough to fulfill the requests of\n\nthe radio unit, the NR RU Intelligent Temperature Handling function forcefully\n\nblanks some PDSCH slots. These slots are counted by the\n\nNRCellDU.pmRadioPdschEmptySlotsForced PM counter. Because\n\ntemperature change is a slower process compared to slot scheduling, the downlink\n\nPDSCH scheduling algorithm does not need to react immediately. It can select which\n\nPDSCH slot to forcefully blank.\n\nForcefully\n\nblanked slots result in increased downlink latency.

The\n\ndecision on the number of used layers is based on actual SINR and SINR difference\n\nmeasurements on PUSCH DMRS.\n\nBenefits\n\nUplink link adaptation improvements allow for the dynamic use of layers in the\n\nuplink. The gNodeB uses two layers when SINR measurements allow. However, it reverts\n\nto the use of a single layer when this option is more reliable for transmission.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nUsing two layers in uplink link adaptation improves uplink throughput. Using a single\n\nlayer when conditions do not allow for two layers improves robustness.\n\nOperation\n\nThe gNodeB selects the most suitable layer for single-layer transmission based on\n\nSINR and SINR difference measurements. It uses the average measured SINR to select\n\nthe MCS while using two layers.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nHardware\n\nNo special hardware requirements.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.\n\n## Appendix A.c: 20.Q4: Periodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH in High-Band\n\nScheduling Requests constitute a set of PUCCH resources transmitted across different\n\nbandwidth parts and cells. The Scheduling Request PUCCH resource is periodic, and can also\n\nbe multiplexed on aperiodic HARQ-ACK PUCCH resources.\n\n| Feature Name:           | Scheduler High-Band   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4904          |\n| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package       |\n| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002          |\n| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node   |\n| Access Type:            | NR                    |\n\nThis feature enhancement allows the network to perform the following actions:\n\n- Configure the UE to transmit the Scheduling Request on the Scheduling Request PUCCH resources\n- Decode a pending Scheduling Request on the periodic Scheduling Request PUCCH resource from multiple UEs at the same time\n\nThe UE can also multiplex Scheduling Request information. Multiplexing occurs on a\n\nHARQ-ACK PUCCH resource, overlapping in time. The network decodes this Scheduling\n\nRequest together with the HARQ-ACK PUCCH resource without negative effect on legacy\n\nPUCCH resources. The periodic Scheduling Request PUCCH resource is supported on the 4\n\ndownlink + 1 uplink TDD pattern in High-Band. However, it is not supported on the legacy\n\n3 downlink + 1 uplink TDD pattern.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe transmission of periodic and multiplexed Scheduling Request information increases\n\nthe probability for the UE to receive the scheduling grant from the gNodeB. The periodic Scheduling Request PUCCH resource can\n\ndecrease the latency of devices using C-DRX.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThe following counters are introduced for the measurement of the periodic Scheduling\n\nRequest PUCCH resource:\n\n- NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSrNote: It is possible that the UE fails to access the node by the Scheduling Request over PUCCH. In such cases, the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSr counter counts the number of received Scheduling Requests over the RACH. This counter is also triggered if a UE performs beam failure recovery within the same wide beam.\n- NRCellDU.pmMacPucchSrPuschGrantLatDistr\n- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlUnresUePucchSrGrant\n\nThis enhancement allows non-active UEs to be scheduled directly on the MCS most\n\nsuitable for the UE, as the gNodeB is aware of its pending\n\nuplink data. In cells with good radio conditions, this results in more pegs on\n\nhigher MCSs in the NRCellDU.pmRadioPuschTable1McsDistr\n\ncounter.\n\nThe NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalMenb counter can be increased with\n\nthe same value as the NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSr counter in the\n\nfollowing cases:\n\n- A high number of active UEs (above 30) are in a cell.\n- Traffic patterns manifest bursty data.\n\nThe impact of this function on the\n\nNRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSr counter is not expected to be\n\nhigh.\n\nOperation\n\nNo impact.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nHardware\n\nNo special hardware requirements.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nENM version 20.2 is supported by this enhancement.\n\n## Appendix A.d: 21.Q1: Improved SCell Downlink Throughput\n\nThe enhancement provides higher downlink throughput with the use of the empty\n\noverlapping CSI-RS symbols for PDSCH data transmission in SCells.\n\n| Feature Name:           | Scheduler High-Band       |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4904              |\n| Value Package Name:     | NR High-Band Base Package |\n| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002              |\n| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node       |\n| Access Type:            | NR                        |\n\nThe enhancement increases the downlink throughput by using overlapping CSI-RS symbols on\n\nSCells when performing beam management procedures.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe downlink throughput is expected to increase when using Downlink Carrier\n\nAggregation. The relative throughput gain increases with the number of connected\n\nusers.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThe expected downlink throughput gain up to 10% depending on the configuration.\n\nThe sector carrier allocation on different PAAM and PAAM segments must be considered\n\nduring configuration.\n\nOperation\n\nThe enhancement uses empty symbols, in mainly CSI-RS slots, on SCells in the\n\nfollowing cases:\n\n- Overlapping with PSCell CSI-RS slots in beam tracking procedures\n- Overlapping with PDCCH for uplink DCI\n- Overlapping link adaptation CSI-RS symbols\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nHardware\n\nNo specific hardware requirement.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nThis enhancement requires an EN-DC-capable UE to operate.\n\n## Appendix A.e: 22.Q1: Improved Periodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH in High-Band\n\nThe feature enhancement improves the ability of the gNodeB to handle situations when\n\nthe UE is unable to send periodic scheduling requests.\n\n| Feature Name:           | Scheduler High-Band   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 4904          |\n| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package       |\n| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002          |\n| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node   |\n| Access Type:            | NR                    |\n\nSummary and Benefits\n\nThe Periodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH function of the Scheduler High-Band feature\n\ncannot operate when the UE loses connection to the gNodeB for longer time periods.\n\nThis feature enhancement improves the ability of the gNodeB to keep the UE connected\n\nto NR, when the UE sends periodic scheduling requests.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThe feature enhancement increases the value of the SCG Active Radio Resource\n\nRetainability, Captured in gNodeB KPI. The value of the KPI increases when the\n\nPeriodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH for High-Band function is active and the value\n\nof the pmRadioPucchFailSr PM counter is high.\n\nThe following PM counters can be used to observe the feature enhancement:\n\n- NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchFailSr\n- NRCellDU.pmRadioPucchSrResourcesRestoredDistr\n- NRCellCU.pmEndcRelUeAbnormalMenb\n\nWhen a scheduling request is detected on RACH, RRC reconfiguration is activated for\n\nthe UE and the pmRadioPucchFailSr PM counter is pegged.\n\nOperation\n\nThe feature enhancement introduces observability for each C-RNTI based on the number\n\nof RRC reconfigurations performed. If the value of the\n\npmRadioPucchFailSr PM counter is abnormally high, the\n\npmRadioPucchSrResourcesRestoredDistr PM counter can be\n\nchecked to determine if this is caused by UE impact or radio conditions.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nHardware\n\nNo special hardware requirements.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nIt is recommended to use ENM version 21.1 or later to support the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement. If the Release Independence Manager application is used, the MOM changes are supported on earlier ENM versions also.\n\nRelated Information\n\nScheduler High-Band\n\n## Appendix A.f: 24.Q1.0: Coverage-Adaptive SR Periodicity for High-Band\n\nThe feature enhancement allows the operator to configure a threshold to adjust the\n\nScheduling Request (SR) periodicity depending on the radio conditions.\n\n| Feature Name           | Scheduler High-Band   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4904          |\n| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package       |\n| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4002          |\n| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node   |\n| Access Type            | NR                    |\n| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional              |\n\nSummary and Benefits\n\nAs a result of failed periodic SRs on PUCCH, the number of abnormal UE releases in\n\nHigh-Band is increased where the cell edge radio conditions are not good enough for\n\nthe UE to get its SR requests served.\n\nThe feature enhancement introduces the SrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg\n\nMO so that the operator can enable the functionality and configure a threshold for\n\ndetermining the quality of UE coverage. The gNodeB selects the SR periodicity based\n\non the radio channel quality of the UE. If a UE is estimated to be in limited\n\ncoverage according to the threshold configured by the operator, the SR periodicity\n\nis increased to the longest possible periodicity. When the UE returns to good radio\n\nconditions, the shorter SR periodicity is reconfigured.\n\nThe feature enhancement provides the benefit of decreasing the number of abnormal UE\n\nreleases at the cell edge.\n\nThe feature enhancement is adapted to the UE Grouping Framework.\n\nThe feature enhancement does not support NR standalone High-Band deployments.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nIf the value of the SCG Active Radio Resource Retainability, Captured in gNodeB KPI\n\ndecreases when the Periodic Scheduling Request on PUCCH for High-Band function is\n\nactivated, the value of this KPI is expected to increase when the feature\n\nenhancement is active.\n\nOperation\n\nThis feature enhancement introduces the SrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg\n\nMO and the following attributes, which are related to enabling and configuring the\n\nSR periodicity threshold:\n\n- SrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg.covAdaptSrPEnabled\n- SrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg.covAdaptSrPNrLowQualThresh\n- SrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg.covAdaptSrPNrQualHyst\n- SrPeriodicityCovAdaptUeCfg.covAdaptSrPStartRsrpThresh\n\nThe feature enhancement introduces the following PM counters:\n\n- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacSrPeriodicitySwitchLimitedCoverage\n- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacSrPeriodicitySwitchGoodCoverage\n- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacLongPsrSinrDistr\n- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacShortPsrSinrDistr\n- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacLongPsrRsrpDistr\n- NRCellDU.pmRadioMacShortPsrRsrpDistr\n\nThe introduced PM counters can be used to observe the number of SR periodicity\n\nswitches that are caused by the following factors:\n\n- Radio condition changes\n- The distribution of SINR and RSRP values measured at the time of reconfiguring the SR based on PUCCH periodicity\n\nThe feature enhancement updates the DuPerCellTrafficRep PM event\n\nwith event parameters that are related to the RRCReconfiguration\n\nmessage.\n\nInterfaces\n\nUplink SINR-based coverage evaluation and SR periodicity reconfiguration might lead\n\nto increased signaling over the Uu interface.\n\nHardware\n\nNo specific hardware requirements.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nIt is recommended to use ENM version 24.10 or later to\n\nsupport the MOM changes introduced by this feature.

A PDU session can contain one\n\nor more QoS flows, which are data flows with specific requirements on QoS. The QoS\n\nflows for a PDU session are mapped to DRBs. A QoS flow usually corresponds to a\n\nservice, for example Voice over NR.\n\nThe QoS Framework feature allows having up to eight QoS flows for a PDU session, and\n\neach QoS flow is mapped to a separate DRB. The PDU sessions can be released\n\nindividually. If the last PDU session is released, the UE is also released into idle\n\nmode.\n\nThe feature adds functionality in the E1, F1, NG, and RRC interfaces needed for\n\ncontrol plane signaling.\n\nQoS Mapping Framework\n\nThe requirements for QoS flows are described by the 5QI. These are provided by the\n\n5GC in the NGAP control plane signaling. In NR SA, the 5QI values are mapped to the\n\nfollowing types of parameters:\n\n- QoS profile parameters\n- Layer 2 and Layer 3 parameters that depend on the QoS requirements for flows\n\nThe QoS Framework feature supports QoS for EN-DC users by a straight mapping of QCI\n\nto 5QI, that is, QCI=x is treated as 5QI=x.\n\nFor more information about QoS flow mapping, see E2E QoS Guideline.\n\nUser Plane Functionality\n\nThe NR SA and NR-DC user plane functionality maps data\n\nflows between the PDU session user plane and Service Data Adaptation Protocol (SDAP)\n\nentities. SDAP transmits data between a gNodeB in NR SA and\n\nNR-DC deployment and the UE, and it also identifies the QoS flows that\n\nPDUs belong to. QoS flow identifiers are used for this purpose. PDUs for the\n\ncorresponding QoS flow are sent between the 5GC and the gNodeB in NR SA\n\nand NR-DC deployment using the PDU session user plane\n\nprotocol. This also helps identify which PDUs the flows belong to.\n\nFor more information about procedures for setting up and releasing PDU sessions, see\n\nNR Standalone.\n\n## 3.1 QoS-Controlled SR Scheduling\n\nWith this function enabled, the initial scheduling request priority starts according\n\nto the highest priority DRB of the UE. The function can be enabled with the\n\nSrHandlingUeCfg.srHandlingMode attribute, and differentiated by the\n\nUE Grouping Framework.\n\nFigure 1   Scheduling Request Priority\n\nOperational Process\n\n1. If the function is enabled, initial scheduling request priority starts at the same priority as the highest priority DRB of the UE.\n2. The priority increases with time, based on channel condition and buffer status.\n3. After a predefined time interval, the scheduling request priority is increased to a higher level than any other DRB of the UE.\n\nFor more information on scheduling, see Scheduler Low-Band and Scheduler Mid-Band.\n\nUE Grouping Framework Integration\n\nThe function can be enabled with the\n\nSrHandlingUeCfg.srHandlingMode attribute set to\n\nSR\\_PRIO\\_5QI. The\n\nSrHandlingUeCfg=Base MO is created\n\nautomatically when the SrHandling MO is created, unless they are\n\ncreated manually in the same transaction. Other MO instances can be created and\n\ndeleted manually for further UE group differentiation, and differentiated by the UE\n\nGrouping Framework. For more information on UE groups, see UE Grouping Framework.\n\nConditional DRBs\n\nSome services have background DRBs that are always active.\n\nWhile configuring the initial scheduling request priority of a UE, conditional DRBs\n\nallow the feature to take the priority of the background DRBs into consideration\n\nonly when the conditional DRB is established.\n\nThe conditions can be configured through the\n\nSrHandlingUeCfg.conditional5qi attribute.\n\n## 3.2 QoS and Downlink Multi-User MIMO Low/Mid-Band Interaction\n\nThe Downlink Multi-User MIMO\n\nLow/Mid-Band\n\nfeature can improve cell capacity by co-scheduling UEs with the same frequency and time\n\nresources.\n\nUEs are normally scheduled according to priority. However, if the Downlink Multi-User\n\nMIMO\n\nLow/Mid-Band\n\nfeature is enabled, the scheduler checks if there are UEs that can be paired on the same\n\nPRB according to the MU-MIMO selection criteria.\n\nTherefore, scheduling is not only based on UE priority, but also on other pairing\n\nopportunities to maximize cell throughput with MU-MIMO.\n\n# 4 Network Impact of QoS Framework\n\nThe feature impacts capacity and interface\n\nsignaling.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThe QoS Framework feature increases capacity to eight PDU sessions for each UE.\n\nInterfaces\n\nSignaling on the NG-C interface is increased due to the higher number of the PDU\n\nsessions allowed.\n\nThe following messages are related to the feature:\n\n- NGAP: PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST\n- NGAP: PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE\n\nThe feature introduces the following messages over the NG-C interface:\n\n- NGAP: PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST\n- NGAP: PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY RESPONSE\n- NGAP: PDU SESSION RESOURCE RELEASE COMMAND\n- NGAP: PDU SESSION RESOURCE RELEASE RESPONSE\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.\n\n# 5 Parameters for QoS Framework\n\nThe QoS-Controlled SR Scheduling function introduces new MOM attributes for\n\nconfiguration.\n\nTable 2\n\n| Parameter                        | Type       | Description          |\n|----------------------------------|------------|----------------------|\n| DU5qi.srHandlingRef              | Introduced | See MOM description. |\n| DUModified5qiUeCfg.srHandlingRef | Introduced | See MOM description. |\n| SrHandling.reservedBy            | Introduced | See MOM description. |\n| SrHandling.ueConfGroupType       | Introduced | See MOM description. |\n| SrHandling.userLabel             | Introduced | See MOM description. |\n| SrHandlingUeCfg.ueGroupList      | Introduced | See MOM description. |\n| SrHandlingUeCfg.prefUeGroupList  | Introduced | See MOM description. |\n| SrHandlingUeCfg.ueConfGroupList  | Introduced | See MOM description. |\n| SrHandlingUeCfg.srHandlingMode   | Introduced | See MOM description. |\n| SrHandlingUeCfg.conditional5qi   | Introduced | See MOM description. |\n\n# 6 Performance of QoS Framework\n\nThis feature has counters and events that are related to PDU session and DRB\n\nestablishment, modification, and\n\nrelease.\n\nKPIs\n\nThis feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).\n\nCounters\n\nThe following counters can be used to observe the feature:\n\n- NRCellCU.pmPduSessionModifyAtt\n- NRCellCU.pmPduSessionModifySucc\n- NRCellCU.pmDrbEstabAtt5qi\n- NRCellCU.pmDrbEstabSucc5qi\n- NRCellCU.pmDrbRelAbnormalAmf5qi\n- NRCellCU.pmDrbRelAbnormalGnb5qi\n- NRCellCU.pmPduSessionRelAbnormalGnb\n- NRCellCU.pmDrbRelNormal5qi\n- NRCellCU.pmPduSessionEstabAtt\n- NRCellCU.pmPduSessionEstabSucc\n- NRCellCU.pmHoExeSuccOutDrbInterGnb5qi\n- NRCellCU.pmHoExeSuccOutDrbEutran5qi\n\nEvents\n\nThe following PM events are related to the feature:\n\n- CuCpNgPduSessionResourceSetupRequest\n- CuCpNgPduSessionResourceSetupResponse\n- CuCpNgPduSessionResourceModifyRequest\n- CuCpNgPduSessionResourceModifyResponse\n- CuCpNgPduSessionResourceReleaseCommand\n- CuCpNgPduSessionResourceReleaseResponse\n\n# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features\n\nNon-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be\n\ndeactivated.\n\nWhile license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features\n\nare activated automatically during node integration. They also do not\n\nhave\n\na software license key associated, which means that they have no\n\nentries in the LKF that is installed on the node.\n\nIn some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured\n\nmanually or have some of\n\ntheir\n\nsubfunctions enabled to work properly.\n\n# 8 Engineering Guidelines for QoS Framework\n\nThe QoS Framework feature is based on the NR Standalone feature. For basic configuration\n\ndetails, see NR Standalone.\n\n## 8.1 Configure PDCP Packet-Reordering Timers\n\nNR PDCP packet-reordering timer configuration options are used for managing\n\nQoS-related parameters for DRBs.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Set the CUCP5qi.tReorderingDl attribute to configure the timer in the UE for reordering packets for PDCP in downlink.\n2. Set the CUCP5qi.tReorderingUl attribute to configure the timer in the gNodeB that is used to detect the loss of PDCP data units in uplink.\n\n## 8.2 Configure RLC Timers\n\nRLC protocol transports PDUs in AM for DRBs. It is responsible for\n\nthe\n\nresegmentation and the reordering of RLC data PDUs.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Configure the following parameters of reception timers for AM and UM RLC on both the UE and the gNodeB to match the round-trip time for HARQ retransmissions. DrbRlcUeCfg.tReassemblyDl DrbRlcUeCfg.tReassemblyUl\n2. RLC timer dependencies: Set the value of the DrbRlcUeCfg.tReassemblyDl attribute to a less than or equal to the value of the CUCP5qi.tReorderingDl timer to avoid unnecessary RLC PDU retention in buffer when the corresponding PDCP packets are already discarded due expiration of the tReordering. Set the value of the DrbRlcUeCfg.tReassemblyUl attribute to less than or equal to the value of the CUCP5qi.tReorderingUl and AqmCfg.tOooUlDelivery attributes to avoid discarding of lately reassembled UL packets.\n3. Configure the following parameters to get faster RLC status feedback during high data rate: DrbRlcUeCfg.tReassemblyDlHighRate DrbRlcUeCfg.tStatusProhibitDlHighRate DrbRlcUeCfg.dlHighRateTimerSwitchEnabled\n4. Tune the value of the parameters to match the round-trip time for HARQ retransmissions using the following formula: t-Reassembly = HARQrtt × MaxHarqTrans HARQrtt The time needed to complete one HARQ transmission or retransmission. MaxHarqTrans The maximum number of HARQ transmissions performed before RLC starts to handle the retransmissions.\n\n## 8.3 Configuration Options Related to NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile\n\nThe NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile feature introduces support for UE\n\ngroup-differentiated user plane configuration and enhancements for downlink cell group\n\nswitching and AQM.\n\nThe NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile introduces and deprecates attributes, which\n\naffect this feature.\n\nFor more information, see NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile.\n\n### 8.3.1 Deprecation Handling\n\nThe following attributes are introduced for deprecation handling:\n\n- GNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled\n- GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled\n- GNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled\n\nThe GNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled and the\n\nGNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled attributes control\n\nwhether the legacy or the updated MOM configuration is used.\n\nIf the following attributes are set to false, legacy attributes are used\n\nwith deprecation handling:\n\n- GNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled\n- GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled\n\nIf the following attributes are set to true, the introduced MOM\n\nconfiguration is used:\n\n- GNBCUUPFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled\n- GNBDUFunction.altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled\n\nNode restart is required after both changes.\n\nBackwards Compatible Changes\n\nFor backwards compatibility, the\n\nGNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled attribute is used and\n\nby default it is set to true.\n\nAll deprecated attribute values are copied from the NRCellDU MO\n\ninstances to the replacement attributes in the CgSwitchCfg MO\n\ninstances.\n\nWhen normal deprecation handling is enabled, the MO instance of the introduced MO\n\nclass corresponding to the NRCellDU MO instance is automatically\n\ndeleted or created.\n\nWhen normal deprecation handling is enabled, and the operator creates an\n\nNRCellDU MO instance, instances of the following MO classes\n\nmust not be created manually:\n\n- CgSwitch\n- CgSwitchCfg\n- CgSwitchUeCfg\n- UeCC\n\nIf the operator wants to create instances of these MO classes together with\n\nNRCellDU MO instances in the same transaction, the creation\n\nof the NRCellDU MO instance must be ordered after the creation of\n\nthe listed MO classes.\n\nNormal deprecation handling only works for NRCellDU MO instances\n\nthat are mapped to one CgSwitch MO instance, and if the number of\n\nCgSwitch MO instances is at most 48. When an\n\nNRCellDU MO instance is created, but there is no\n\nCgSwitch MO instance left, deprecation handling is not\n\napplied for that cell. Therefore, default values are used instead for the following\n\nattributes:\n\n- NRCellDU.endcDlLegSwitchEnabled\n- NRCellDU.endcDlNrLowQualThresh\n- NRCellDU.endcDlNrQualHyst\n\nIt is possible to control which configuration to use for each\n\nNRCellDU instance by setting the\n\nGNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled attribute to\n\nfalse, even when more than 48 NRCellDU MO\n\ninstances are created. There is still a limitation of having 48 plus one\n\nCgSwitch MO instances for configuration. Additionally, UE\n\ngrouping is only supported when the\n\nGNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled attribute is set to\n\nfalse.\n\nFigure 2 shows normal deprecation\n\nhandling.\n\nFigure 2   Normal Deprecation Handling\n\nIt is recommended to configure the user plane attributes in the\n\nCgSwitchCfg MO class if the class is available in the\n\nManagement System.\n\nIt is recommended to update the attribute values in the introduced MO classes first,\n\nwhen deprecation handling is disabled and the\n\nGNBDUFunction.servAdapUPProfDepHEnabled attribute is set to\n\nfalse.\n\nDisabling deprecation handling prevents attributes in the\n\nCgSwitchCfg MO instance from being overwritten in the\n\nintroduced management system versions. In these use cases, the\n\nCgSwitchCfg MO instance is visible and used instead of the\n\ndeprecated attributes.\n\nNon-Backwards Compatible Changes\n\nChanges in the following MO classes are non-backwards compatible because of the\n\nreduced cardinality of the introduced MO classes:\n\n- AqmCfg\n- DcDlCfg\n- Drb\n- DrbUeCfg\n- UserPlaneProfile\n- UserPlaneProfileUeCfg\n\nTherefore, it is recommended to configure the user plane attributes in these MO\n\nclasses if they are available in the Management System.\n\nIf the change to the introduced MO classes and attributes is not performed before the\n\ndeprecation window ends, default values are applied if no configuration is\n\nprovided.\n\nFigure 3 and Figure 4 show alternative deprecation\n\nhandling, when the altDepHServAdapUPProfEnabled attribute is set\n\nto true.\n\nFigure 3   Alternative Deprecation Handling in\n\nGNBCUUPFunction\n\nFigure 4   Alternative Deprecation Handling in\n\nGNBDUFunction\n\nIt is recommended to migrate as soon as possible to the introduced attributes to\n\nfully realize the benefits of the new configuration management for this feature, and\n\navoid using the following attributes:\n\n- CUUP5qi.aqmMode\n- CUUP5qi.dcDlPdcpAggrPrioCg\n- CUUP5qi.dcDlPdcpAggrTimeDiffCg\n- CUUP5qi.dcDlPdcpAggrTimeDiffProhibit\n- CUUP5qi.dcDlPdcpAggrTimeDiffThresh\n-

introduced MO classes and attributes is not performed before the\n\ndeprecation window ends and no configuration is provided, the default values are\n\nused for these attributes.\n\n### 8.3.2 Migration Information\n\nThe NR Service-Adaptive User Plane Profile feature introduces attributes and MO\n\nclasses for UE group-differentiated user plane configuration, for downlink cell group\n\nswitching, and for AQM.\n\nMO classes and attributes are introduced under the GNBCUUPFunction and\n\nthe GNBDUFunction MO classes to support the introduced\n\nfunctionalities. These classes and attributes co-exist with deprecated attributes.\n\nTherefore, the migration to the introduced attributes is recommended.\n\nGuidelines for Migration from the GNBCUUPFunction MO Class to\n\nthe UserPlaneProfile MO Class\n\nThe migration described in this section does not use the UE Grouping Framework and\n\ndoes not create UE-specific configuration.\n\nThe following rules must be considered:\n\n- There is a single instance of the UserPlaneProfile MO class.\n- The attribute values defined under the UserPlaneProfileUeCfg=Base MO instance are applied to all 5QIs and QCIs.\n\nTable 3   Mapping between Legacy and Introduced Attributes under the\n\nGNBCUUPFunction MO Class\n\n| Legacy Attribute                       | Introduced Attribute                           |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| GNBCUUPFunction.dcDlAggActTime         | UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dcDlAggActTime           |\n| GNBCUUPFunction.dcDlAggExpiryTimer     | UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dcDlAggExpiryTimer       |\n| GNBCUUPFunction.dcDlPdcpInitialMcgRate | UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dlPdcpMcgInitialRate     |\n| GNBCUUPFunction.dcDlPdcpInitialScgRate | UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dlPdcpScgInitialRate     |\n| GNBCUUPFunction.dlPdcpSpsTargetTimeLTE | UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dlPdcpMcgSpsTargetTime   |\n| GNBCUUPFunction.dlPdcpSpsTargetTimeNR  | UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dlPdcpScgSpsTargetTime   |\n| GNBCUUPFunction.endcDlNrRetProhibTimer | UserPlaneProfileUeCfg.dlPdcpScgRetProhibitTime |\n\nGuidelines for Migration from the CUUP5qi MO Class to the\n\nDrb and the UserPlaneProfile MO\n\nClasses\n\nThe migration described in this section does not use the UE Grouping Framework and\n\ndoes not create UE-specific configuration.\n\nThe following rules must be considered:\n\n- The CUUP5qi.drbRef attribute must reference a Drb MO instance.\n- The DrbUeCfg=Base MO instance must reference an AqmCfg MO instance and a DcDlCfg MO instance.\n- Two or more CUUP5qi MO instances with the same attribute values can reference a single Drb MO instance. This results in the same AqmCfg and DcDlCfg MO instances being used for such CUUP5qi MO instances.\n- Different Drb instances with a child DrbUeCfg=Base MO instance are needed for different AQM and PDCP settings. This results in different AqmCfg and DcDlCfg MO instances.\n- Automatically created Drb MO instances can be referenced by any CUUP5qi MO instance.\n- Automatically created instances of the following MO classes can be referenced by a Drb MO instance that is referenced by any CUUP5qi MO instance: AqmCfg DcDlCfg DrbUeCfg\n- Manually created instances of L4sCfg MO class can be referenced by a Drb MO instance that is referenced by any CUUP5qi instance.\n\nTable 4   Mapping between Legacy and Introduced Attributes under the\n\nCUUP5qi MO Class\n\n| Legacy Attribute                                           | Introduced Attribute                                                                                             | Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| CUUP5qi.aqmMode                                            | AqmCfg.aqmMode                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| CUUP5qi.dcDlPdcpAggrPrioCg                                 | DcDlCfg.dcDlAggAllowed                                                                                           | If the CUUP5qi.dcDlPdcpAggrPrioCg                                         attribute is set to NO_AGGREGATION, the                                             DcDlCfg.dcDlAggAllowed attribute is                                         set to false.

be considered:\n\n- The DU5qi.drbUpRef attribute must reference a DrbUp MO instance.\n- The DrbUpUeCfg=Base MO instance must reference an AqmCfg MO instance.\n- Two or more DU5qi MO instances with the same attribute values can reference a single DrbUp MO instance. This results in the same AqmCfg MO instance being used for any DU5qi MO instances.\n- Different DrbUp MO instances with a child DrbUpUeCfg=Base MO instance are needed for different AQM settings. Different AqmCfg MO instances are needed.\n- Automatically created instances of the following MO classes can be referenced by any DU5qi MO instance: AqmCfg DrbUp DrbUpUeCfg\n\nTable 5   Mapping between Existing and Introduced Attributes under the DU5qi MO\n\nClass\n\n| Existing Attribute                                     | Introduced Attribute   | Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| DU5qi.aqmMode                                          | AqmCfg.aqmMode         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| DU5qi.estimatedE2ERTT                                  | AqmCfg.estimatedE2ERTT |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| DU5qi.packetDelayBudget  DU5qi.packetDelayBudgetOffset | AqmCfg.tDiscardDl      | The AqmCfg.tDiscardDl attribute equals the                                         sum of the DU5qi.packetDelayBudget and                                         the DU5qi.packetDelayBudgetOffset                                         attributes. |\n\n# Appendix A: Feature Change History\n\nThis section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the\n\nnetwork.\n\n## Appendix A.a: 20.Q3: Multiple DRBs per PDU sessions\n\nThis enhancement supports multiple DRBs for a PDU session, and updates the procedures\n\nrelated to QoS\n\nflows.\n\n| Feature Name:           | QoS Framework       |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 5157        |\n| Value Package Name:     | NR Base Package     |\n| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 4002        |\n| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node |\n| Access Type:            | NR                  |\n\nBenefits\n\nUp to four DRBs can be set up in one PDU session.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nNo impact.\n\nOperation\n\nThe following procedures are updated to support multiple QoS flows:\n\n- PDU Session Resource Setup\n- PDU Session Resource Modify\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nHardware\n\nNo special hardware requirements.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.\n\n## Appendix A.b: 22.Q4: QoS-Controlled SR Scheduling\n\nThe feature enhancement improves QoS handling in uplink scheduling in high load by\n\noptimizing the scheduling priority of scheduling requests.\n\n| Feature Name           | QoS Framework       |\n|------------------------|---------------------|\n| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5157        |\n| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package     |\n| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4002        |\n| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node |\n| Access Type            | NR                  |\n| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional            |\n\nSummary and Benefits\n\nBy adapting the scheduling priority of scheduling requests based on the DRBs of the\n\nUE, the uplink QoS for the UEs with high-priority DRBs is maintained. High-priority\n\nDRBs can be, for example, voice bearers.\n\nThe feature enhancement allows the feature to be controlled through the UE Grouping\n\nFramework and use different configurations for different UE groups.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nPacket loss is decreased during high load for high-priority DRBs.\n\nScheduling request latency is slightly increased for DRBs with lower priority. This\n\ncan be monitored through the\n\nNRCellDU.pmMacPucchSrPuschGrantLatDistr PM counter.\n\nOperation\n\nThe feature enhancement introduces the following MO classes:\n\n- SrHandling\n- SrHandlingUeCfg\n\nThe enhancement introduces the following attributes:\n\n- SrHandling.reservedBy\n- SrHandling.ueConfGroupType\n- SrHandling.userLabel\n- DU5qi.srHandlingRef\n- DUModified5qiUeCfg.srHandlingRef\n- SrHandlingUeCfg.ueGroupList\n- SrHandlingUeCfg.prefUeGroupList\n- SrHandlingUeCfg.ueConfGroupList\n- SrHandlingUeCfg.srHandlingMode\n- SrHandlingUeCfg.conditional5qi\n\nThese MO classes and attributes allow the feature to create multiple customized\n\nprofiles for scheduling request weight handling.

LTE-NR\n\ncoexistence occurs if LTE and NR carriers are located within the same frequency\n\nband. Carriers within the same frequency band can overlap, can be adjacent or\n\nlocated further away. In each case where LTE and NR carriers are located within the\n\nsame frequency band, the NR TDD pattern must be synchronized with the LTE TDD\n\npattern for macro networks. Synchronized TDD patterns require equal N\\_TA offsets.\n\nThe value setting for the LTE N\\_TA offset is circa 20 μs. The value of the NR N\\_TA\n\noffset must be adapted to the value of the LTE N\\_TA offset.\n\nThe NRCellDU.nrLteCoexistence attribute must be set to identical\n\nvalues for all NR cells sharing a TDD or an FDD radio unit. The attribute must be\n\nset to true when LTE and NR carriers are in the same frequency\n\nband. It must be set to false when only NR carriers are located in\n\nthe frequency band.\n\nRelated concepts\n\nPhysical Resources\n\nPhysical Signals\n\nPhysical Channels\n\n## 4.1 Physical Resources\n\nPhysical resources concern information related to antenna ports, Resource Elements\n\nand Resource Blocks. Characteristics of the NR cell and bandwidth parts are also\n\ndescribed.\n\nAntenna Port\n\nAn antenna port is defined by its associated channel or signal.\n\nThe supported set of antenna ports depends on the signal configuration in the\n\ncell.\n\nResource Element and Resource Block\n\nOne OFDM symbol is the smallest time domain unit. A subcarrier is the smallest\n\nfrequency domain unit. One OFDM symbol in a single subcarrier is called a Resource\n\nElement.\n\nA Resource Block is defined as 12 consecutive subcarriers in the frequency\n\ndomain.\n\nNR Cell\n\nThe NR cell involves the following characteristics:\n\n- Defined by the Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) information.\n- Supports cell bandwidth up to 100 MHz.\n\nThe PCI is for cell identification on the physical layer\n\nand determined by the SSB. The UE uses the PCI to decode physical layer data\n\ntransmitted by the gNodeB.\n\nThe PCI of an NR cell is configured by using the\n\nNRCellDU.nRPCI attribute.\n\nThe PCI must be planned to achieve dual connectivity and\n\noptimal radio network performance. To avoid performance degradation, unique PCIs\n\nmust be configured within the same site and as neighbors and neighbors of\n\nneighbors.\n\nBandwidth Parts\n\nA single Bandwidth Part (BWP) is defined as equivalent to the cell bandwidth.\n\nA BWP is a contiguous set of resource blocks. It entails the following\n\ncharacteristics:\n\n- A BWP is associated with a numerology.\n- PDCCH, PUCCH, PDSCH, PUSCH and DMRS within a BWP share the same numerology.\n- A UE is limited to one active BWP at a time.\n\n## 4.2 Physical Signals\n\nBesides physical resources and physical channels, physical signals are also part of\n\nthe physical layer.\n\nThe downlink physical signals are shown in Table 4.\n\nTable 4   Downlink Physical Signals\n\n| Signal                                         | Mid-Band      |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Demodulation Reference Signals                 | Supported     |\n| Channel State Information Reference Signals(1) | Supported     |\n| Phase Tracking Reference Signal                | Not supported |\n| Tracking Reference Signals                     | Supported     |\n| Primary Synchronization Signals                | Supported     |\n| Secondary Synchronization Signals              | Supported     |\n\n(1)\n\nCSI-RS for channel acquisition.\n\nThe uplink physical signals are shown in Table 5.\n\nTable 5   Uplink Physical Signals\n\n| Signal                          | Mid-Band      |\n|---------------------------------|---------------|\n| Demodulation Reference Signals  | Supported     |\n| Phase Tracking Reference Signal | Not supported |\n| Sounding Reference Signals      | Supported     |\n\n### 4.2.1 Synchronization Signals\n\nThe Synchronization Signal and the PBCH Block constitute the SSB.\n\nThe SSB defines an NR cell in which it is used for frame synchronization.\n\nSynchronization Signal and PBCH Block (SSB)\n\nThe SSB consists of the following signal types:\n\n- Primary Synchronization Signal (PSS)\n- Secondary Synchronization Signal (SSS)\n- PBCH (including DMRS)\n\nThe SSB features the following characteristics:\n\n- One SSB is transmitted every 20 ms. The SSB can be configured with the NRCellDU.ssbPeriodicity attribute.\n- One SSB occupies 20 Resource Blocks over four consecutive OFDM symbols.\n- Mid-Band supports 30 kHz subcarrier spacing.\n\nNR cell search is based on the SSB. It involves the following functions:\n\n- The UE performs matched filtering to find the PSS.\n- The UE detects the SSS in the frequency domain.\n\nThe SSB Power Boost feature can increase the SSB\n\ntransmission power in Mid-Band. Increased SSB power enables the faster setup and\n\nbetter coverage of SCG radio resources.\n\nThe NR SSB Time Shift Mid-Band feature can be used to shift\n\nSSBs in the time domain. Time-shifted SSBs reduce the interference from PDSCH and\n\nneighbor cell SSBs.\n\n#### 4.2.1.1 Synchronization Signal Block Configuration Parameters\n\nThe SSB defines an NR cell in which it is used for frame\n\nsynchronization.

This signal type also provides information\n\nrelated to channel estimation and demodulation. TRS periodicity can be configured with the\n\nhelp of a dedicated attribute.\n\nUnlike LTE, NR does not use the Cell-specific Reference Signal (CRS). Hence, TRS is\n\nintroduced for fine synchronization to perform the following:\n\n- Synchronization in time and frequency.\n- Providing doppler and delay spread information required for channel estimation and demodulation.\n\nTRS is realized using periodic CSI-RS resources. The periodicity of TRS can be\n\nconfigured for each cell by the NRCellDU.trsPeriodicity attribute.\n\nThe attribute is set to 40 ms by default in Mid-Band. In each period, TRS is mapped to\n\ntwo symbols in two consecutive slots. The TRS power relative to PDSCH is controlled by\n\nthe NRCellDU.trsPowerBoosting attribute. Power boosting is realized\n\nby the configuration of periodic ZP-CSI-RS resources in the TRS symbols.\n\n### 4.2.3 CSI Reference Signal\n\nIn addition to the CSI-RS resources configured for TRS,\n\nCSI-RS is also configured for CSI acquisition.\n\nA periodic CSI-RS resource is configured for channel\n\nmeasurements. The periodicity of the CSI-RS transmission is configured by the\n\nNRCellDU.csiRsPeriodicity attribute. The CSI-RS resource spans\n\nall of the Resource Blocks of the BWP. The CSI-RS resource contains 2, 4 or 8 ports, and\n\noccupies 1× 2, 1× 4 or 2 × 4 Resource Elements respectively in the slot of every\n\nResource Block.\n\nIn addition to the CSI-RS, a CSI-IM resource with the same\n\ntransmission periodicity is configured for interference measurements. The CSI-IM\n\nresource spans all the Resource Blocks of the BWP. It occupies 2 × 2 Resource Elements\n\nin the slot of each Resource Block.\n\nAperiodic CSI reporting is used, where the CSI report is\n\nmultiplexed on PUSCH. The UE is configured to report CSI according to the type 1\n\nsingle-panel codebook. In addition, the wideband Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI) and\n\nthe Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) are used.\n\nFor details on the configuration of 2-, 4-, and 8-port CSI-RS, see the CSI-RS\n\nResource Configuration for the NR Cell section in Manage Radio Network.\n\nAdditional licensing also allows the configuration of 16- and 32-port CSI-RS resources.\n\nFor more information on these configuration options, see the Feature\n\nOperation section of Massive MIMO Mid-Band.\n\nFor the mapping options of CSI-RSs and CSI-IMs to Physical Resources, see Control Channel Guideline.\n\nRelated concepts\n\nTracking Reference Signal\n\nRelated Information\n\n3GPP TS 38.211, NR; Physical channels and modulation\n\n### 4.2.4 Sounding Reference Signal\n\nThe Advanced Downlink Single-User MIMO Mid-Band and the Advanced Downlink Multi-User\n\nMIMO Mid-Band features both use SRS. With the help of SRS, the gNodeB can estimate the\n\ndownlink channel between the UE and the gNodeB, which is used for beamforming in the\n\nPDSCH.\n\nThe following characteristics apply to both periodic and aperiodic SRS:\n\n- SRS is configured with the use of antenna switching.\n- On RAN Compute units supporting Massive MIMO radio units in RAN Compute group 5 and higher, up to 16 SRS ports are available in the uplink symbols carrying SRS.\n- On other RAN Compute units supporting Massive MIMO radio units, up to 8 SRS ports are available in the uplink symbols carrying SRS.\n- The SRS power, that is the p0 nominal value, is configured with the NRCellDU.pZeroNomSrs attribute.\n- Since SRSs are scheduled in unused uplink symbols in special slots, resources are not taken from PUSCH data. Because of this, the SRS does not cause any extra overhead for PUSCH.\n\nPeriodic SRS\n\nFor periodic SRS, a UE can be configured with a RRCReconfiguration\n\nmessage to periodically transmit the SRS in the uplink over the configured\n\nbandwidth.\n\nThe following characteristics apply to the periodic SRS used for advanced\n\nbeamforming:\n\n- A full-band SRS resource spans one uplink OFDM symbol in a special slot.\n- A half-band SRS resource spans two uplink OFDM symbols in a special slot.\n- Periodicity is with 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 slots. The default periodicity is 40 slots.\n- SRS periodicity can be controlled through the NRCellDU.srsPeriodicity attribute. This attribute can be used to balance the number of UEs configured for SRS against the throughput gain for each UE.\n\nFigure 4   Periodic SRS Mapping Example with Two UEs Using Different Comb\n\nOffsets\n\nAperiodic SRS\n\nFor aperiodic SRS, the gNodeB triggers a UE to transmit aperiodic SRS on demand\n\nthrough DCI format 1\\_1. The UE is triggered to transmit SRS aperiodically depending\n\non the demand in terms of UE traffic.\n\nThe following characteristics apply to the aperiodic SRS used for advanced\n\nbeamforming:\n\n- Four uplink symbols need to be configured in the special subframe.\n- The first and third symbol for uplink in the special slot can be configured for aperiodic SRS.\n- The ports configured in the uplink symbols for carrying SRS are dynamically shared among the active aperiodic SRS users.\n- Half-band SRS is not supported for aperiodic SRS.\n\nFigure 5   Aperiodic SRS Mapping Example with Two UEs Using Different Comb Offsets\n\nin SSF 6:4:4A full-band SRS resource spans one or two uplink OFDM symbols in the\n\nspecial slot.\n\nCoexisting Aperiodic and Periodic SRS\n\nFor periodic SRS, a UE can be configured with a RRCReconfiguration\n\nmessage to periodically transmit the SRS in the uplink over the configured\n\nbandwidth.\n\nThe following characteristics apply to the periodic SRS used for advanced\n\nbeamforming:\n\n- A full-band SRS resource spans one or two uplink OFDM symbols in thePeriodicity is with 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 slots.

This is realized by the configuration of a Common Search Space and\n\na UE-Specific Search Space. Both search spaces have a monitoring periodicity of one slot\n\nwith the duration of one symbol.\n\nThe supported aggregation levels of the PDCCH candidates depend on the cell bandwidth,\n\nand can reach up to 16 Control Channel Elements (CCE).\n\nDownlink time and frequency resources for PDCCH are allocated in the form of a Control\n\nChannel Resource Set (CORESET). In NR SA, the following types of CORESET can be\n\nconfigured:\n\n- CORESET#0 is configured for the Common Search Space.\n- CORESET#1 is configured for the UE-Specific Search Space.\n\nIn EN-DC, the CORESET types have the following configuration:\n\n- CORESET#0 is not configured for the PDCCH, because LTE is used for common control signaling.\n- CORESET#1 is configured for both the Common Search Space and the UE-Specific Search Space.\n\nFor more information about CORESETs, see Manage Radio Network.\n\nPDCCH Link Adaptation is used to adjust the number of PDCCH CCEs dynamically. PDCCH CCEs\n\nare allocated for DCI transmission in user-specific control signaling. The number of\n\nCCEs transmitted for the PDCCH is based on\n\nthe channel\n\nquality and the DCI\n\nsize.\n\nRelated concepts\n\nDownlink Channels\n\n#### 4.3.1.2 PDSCH\n\nThe PDSCH carries the downlink transport block.\n\nThe PDSCH supports the following:\n\n- Modulation up to 256-QAM\n- Multiple MIMO layers for CPRI and eCPRI radios\n\nResource allocation is performed in the frequency domain using type 0 resource\n\nallocation (bitmap). In the time domain, the resource allocation of PDSCH is done by DCI\n\nin the same slot, using type A PDSCH mapping. The PDSCH aggregation factor equals one.\n\nThis means that a DCI schedules one PDSCH in one slot only.\n\nRelated concepts\n\nDownlink Channels\n\n#### 4.3.1.3 PBCH\n\nThe PBCH carries part of the system information required by the UE to access the\n\nnetwork.\n\nTogether with the PSS and the SSS, PBCH forms an SSB or PBCH block. The PBCH block is\n\npart of the initial access procedure.\n\nRelated concepts\n\nDownlink Channels\n\n### 4.3.2 Uplink Channels\n\nPUCCH carries uplink control information. PUSCH carries the uplink transport block\n\nand uplink control information. PRACH is used for random access and allows the gNodeB to estimate the delay between itself and the\n\nUE.\n\nPUCCH\n\nPUCCH carries the following types of uplink control information:\n\n- HARQ-ACKs and HARQ-NACKs\n- Scheduling Requests (SRs)\n\nPUCCH resources are configured with the following characteristics:\n\n- 14 symbol length\n- PUCCH formats 1 and 3\n- Intra-slot frequency hopping\n\nPUSCH\n\nPUSCH carries the uplink transport block. It supports up to 64-QAM in the uplink by\n\ndefault. The 256-QAM modulation scheme is supported if the 256-QAM Uplink Low/Mid-Band feature is active. One MIMO\n\nlayer is enabled by default for each UE, using the codebook-based transmission\n\nscheme. The number of MIMO layers can be increased up to four in each cell if the\n\nUplink Multi-User MIMO\n\nLow/Mid-Band feature is active.\n\nTransmission with transform precoding disabled is supported.This means that the\n\nCP-OFDM waveform is used. The DFTS-OFDM waveform can be used if the DFTS-OFDM Waveform in Uplink feature is active.\n\nFor resource allocation in the frequency domain, type 1 resource allocation (start or\n\nlength) is used. In the time domain, resource allocation for PUSCH is performed by\n\nDCI at least two slots in advance. Type A PUSCH mapping is used in the time domain.\n\nThe PUSCH aggregation factor equals one, which means that the DCI schedules one\n\nPUSCH in one slot only. IRC receiver processing is used to mitigate uplink\n\ninterference.\n\nPRACH\n\nPRACH carries the RACH preamble sequences. PRACH can be configured with the following\n\ncharacteristics:\n\n- Preamble format B4 with 30 kHz subcarrier spacing or format 0 with 1.25kHz subcarrier spacing. Format 0 can be used if the PRACH Enhancements Mid-Band feature is active.\n- One RACH occasion every 10 ms.\n- 16 random access preambles in each RACH occasion.\n\nFor more information on the supported TDD patterns and configuration indexes, see\n\nRandom Access.\n\n# 5 Network Impact of Physical Layer Mid-Band\n\nPhysical Layer Mid-Band supports specific carrier bandwidths. For NSA functions, it\n\nrequires an EN-DC-capable UE.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThe Mid-Band feature supports the following carrier bandwidths:\n\n- 10 MHz\n- 15 MHz\n- 20 MHz\n- 30 MHz\n- 40 MHz\n- 50 MHz\n- 60 MHz\n- 70 MHz\n- 80 MHz\n- 90 MHz\n- 100 MHz\n\nThe throughput might be increased when using 10 MHz or 15 MHz carrier bandwidths.\n\nFor more information on feature-related capacities, see Supported Capacity and Configurations for NR RAN.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nThe feature requires an EN-DC-capable UE.

          |\n\nThe functionality enables dynamic adjustment in the number of CCEs allocated for the\n\ntransmission of Downlink Control Information (DCI) in user-specific control signaling.\n\nIn addition, the functionality allows for using the maximum number of available CCEs on\n\neach bandwidth.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nNR PDCCH Link Adaptation can improve coverage for user-specific control signaling. It\n\nuses channel quality measurements to provide the optimal number of PDCCH CCEs. The\n\nfunctionality can impact capacity in terms of Scheduling Entities (SEs) each TTI. In\n\na typical cell deployment, overall capacity improvement is expected. It is also\n\npossible that most devices are in poor radio conditions, requiring the allocation of\n\nhigher PDCCH CCE aggregation levels. In such cases, capacity cannot be improved.\n\nHowever, the improvement in coverage does not occur if the overall coverage is\n\nlimited by the following elements:\n\n- PDCCH Common Search Space (CSS)\n- Other physical channels and signals\n\nThe PDCCH CCE aggregation levels are selected with a target of 1% BLER.

When an eNodeB receives a request, it directs the\n\nUE to GERAN or UTRAN frequencies.\n\nThe primary CS service is traditional voice traffic. CS fallback is the only method to provide\n\ntraditional voice services for single radio UEs unless IMS VoIP services are\n\navailable.\n\nThe CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN feature supports the UE to release from the LTE network and\n\nattach to the neighboring GERAN or UTRAN with minimal disruption for the end\n\nuser.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nMore information about this feature and related topics can be found in 3GPP TS 23.272\n\n9.3.0.\n\n# 2 Dependencies of CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN\n\nThe Coverage-Triggered GERAN, TD-SCDMA, and WCDMA Session Continuity features are\n\nprerequisites to the CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN feature.

The UE sends an NAS extended service request to the MME requesting a CS fallback. The UE requests the CS service either as a response to a user activity in RRC Connected mode or as a response to a paging message with a CS fallback flag in RRC Idle mode.\n2. The MME sends an S1-AP message with a CS fallback indicator to the eNodeB. The S1-AP message can be one of the following: A UE context modification request in RRC Connected mode. A UE context initialization request in RRC Idle mode.\n3. The eNodeB selects a frequency for the redirection. The selection is based on the following: No CSFB measurements are ordered to determine what IRAT cells the UE can detect. For CS fallback started from RRC Idle mode, call establishment time can be shortened by proceeding directly with RRC connection release and skipping the following RRC messages: Security mode setup RRC connection reconfiguration Note: The skipping of the security mode setup and RRC connection reconfiguration messages can be enabled or disabled through the ENodeBFunction.csfbSkipSmcRrcFromIdleMode attribute. When several possible target frequencies have the same priority, the eNodeB applies a round robin scheme for the selection. The eNodeB takes an information element Registered LAI into account when deciding to which frequency a UE is to be redirected during a CS Fallback procedure. The information element Registered LAI can be received in the following messages: If the information element is received, it takes precedence over the priorities configured for frequencies. Otherwise legacy behavior applies.\n    - UE capabilities\n    - CS fallback frequency priorities defined by the following parameters: GeranFreqGroupRelation.csFallbackPrio UtranFreqRelation.csFallbackPrio UtranTDDFreqRelation.csFallbackPrio\n    - Initial context setup request\n    - UE context initialization request\n4. The eNodeB initiates a blind RRC connection release with redirection by sending an RRC connection release message directing the UE to the selected frequency. The node also sends an S1-AP UE context release request to the MME.\n5. The UE changes RAT and starts accessing the new RAT attaching to the indicated target frequency.\n6. The UE sends a CM service request to the BSC or RNC. Once the request is accepted, the UE starts the CS session.\n\nOnce the UE is attached to the target RAT, it can continue to request packet switched\n\nservices if those are available.\n\nThe UE returns to E-UTRAN when it goes to RRC Idle mode and a cell\n\nreselection is initiated.\n\n# 4 Network Impact of CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN\n\nThe implementation of this feature has no impact on the network.\n\n# 5 Parameters for CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN\n\nThe CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN feature introduces parameters.\n\nTable 2   Parameters\n\n| Parameter                                 | Type       | Description          |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------|\n| ENodeBFunction.csfbSkipSmcRrcFromIdleMode | Introduced | See MOM description. |\n| GeranFreqGroupRelation.csFallbackPrio     | Introduced | See MOM description. |\n| UtranFreqRelation.csFallbackPrio          | Introduced | See MOM description. |\n| UtranTDDFreqRelation.csFallbackPrio       | Introduced | See MOM description. |\n| PlmnInfo.actualPlmn                       | Introduced | See MOM description. |\n| PlmnInfo.csfbTargetRat                    | Introduced | See MOM description. |\n\n# 6 Performance of CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN\n\nThe CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN feature introduces counters that are increased for\n\neach triggered CS fallback.\n\nKPIs\n\nThis feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).\n\nPerformance Indicator\n\nThe table lists the a Performance Indicator associated with the feature, and the\n\nformula.\n\nTable 3   Performance Indicator\n\nCounters\n\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtRelCsfbGsm\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtRelCsfbGsm\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtRelCsfbWcdma\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtRelCsfbWcdma\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtRelCsfbTdScdma\n\nEvents\n\nThis feature has no associated events.\n\n# 7 Activate CS Fallback to GERAN and UTRAN\n\nTo use the feature, it must be activated following the\n\nusual feature activation procedure.\n\nPrerequisites\n\n- The license key is installed in the node.\n- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.\n- There is GERAN or UTRAN coverage, or both, in the area covered by the LTE cell.\n- At least one frequency relation is defined for mobility.

Selected radios can be found in\n\nRadio Node Configurations.\n\nAll sector carriers within a combined cell must have the same number of antennas both\n\nin the downlink and uplink directions. The number of downlink and uplink antennas\n\ncan differ within the same sector carrier. A sector carrier with some or all of its\n\nantennas disabled is degraded or disabled, respectively, and it is not included in\n\nthe combined cell.\n\nIf some antennas belonging to a sector carrier that is included in a combined cell\n\nare disabled, the system initiates automatic cell lock and unlock to exclude the\n\naffected sector carrier from the combined cell. Cell lock and unlock results in a\n\nshort-term cell outage.\n\nIf all antennas belonging to a sector carrier that is initially excluded from a\n\ncombined cell are enabled, the system initiates automatic cell lock and unlock to\n\nadd the affected sector carrier to the combined cell. Cell lock and unlock results\n\nin short-term cell outage.\n\nA given sector carrier can only be connected to one combined cell, it is not a\n\nfeasible configuration to connect it to multiple combined cells.\n\nThe delay difference between sector carriers within a combined cell must be less than\n\n50 µs, which corresponds to a maximum distance of 10 km (pure fiber length).\n\nOtherwise, the cell is not enabled, and the Resource Configuration\n\nFailure alarm is raised. To cease the alarm and to enable the\n\ncombined cell, the difference in fiber length must be less than 10 km. This also\n\nmeans that the values of the RfBranch.dlTrafficDelay and the\n\nRfBranch.ulTrafficDelay MOs cannot differ more than 50000\n\nbetween the different sector carriers within the same cell.\n\nTo benefit from the macrodiversity on the PUSCH and PDSCH data channel, the sector\n\ncarriers must not be placed more than 1500 m apart.\n\nHeterogeneous network deployment can be configured in conjunction with the Combined\n\nCell feature. However, possible unequal sector powers at different radio types are\n\nnot taken into account in the downlink sector selection.\n\nDownlink interference mitigation is not performed for the secondary cell when using\n\nthe Carrier Aggregation feature together with the Combined Cell feature, since all\n\nsectors of the secondary cell are used for the downlink data transmission in the\n\ncombined cell.\n\nThe following configurations are supported for Baseband radio node only:\n\n- Combined cell with 9-12 sectors with 2TX/2RX antennas in each sector\n- Combined cell with up to six sectors with 4TX/4RX antennas in each sector\n\nNB-IoT coexistence with standalone deployment mode is not supported.\n\nThe Combined Cell feature with in-band or guard band\n\ndeployment modes NB-IoT coexistence has the following limitations:\n\n- NB-IoT coexistence with an LTE combined cell is only supported for NB-IoT in-band and guard band deployment modes.\n- The host LTE cell must be configured with two sector carriers with 2TX/ 2RX. No other antenna combinations are supported.\n- By default, without manual configuration, the first sector carrier of the host LTE combined cell is used for the hosted NB-IoT cell. Manual configuration is available in one of the sector carriers of the host LTE combined cell.\n\nIf two Radio Gateway units are used, the EUtranCellTDD MO or\n\nEUtranCellFDD MO must have its\n\nSectorCarrier MOs allocated to Radio units that are connected\n\nto the same Radio Gateway. The Inconsistent\n\nConfiguration alarm is raised if the Combined Cell is allocated\n\nto both Radio Gateways.\n\nNetwork Requirements\n\nRegarding the supported LTE combined cell configurations, see details in Features for Radio Configurations.\n\nRelated Information\n\nNB-IoT Cell Coexistence with LTE Combined Cell\n\n# 3 Feature Operation of Combined Cell\n\nThe Combined Cell feature allows multiple sector carriers to belong to the same\n\ncell.\n\nThe sector carriers can either be located indoors or outdoors. However, all sector carriers\n\nthat are present in the same cell are considered as one logical cell with the same PCI. Figure 1 provides an overview of the feature concept.\n\nFigure 1   Overview Concept of the Combined Cell Feature\n\nIn a combined cell, multiple sector carriers can serve the same cell. The individual radios\n\nwithin a combined cell can have different output power setting configurations. In a combined\n\ncell, all radios are connected to the same Baseband Unit, however the different\n\noutput power is not considered for the sector evaluation.\n\nThe Combined Cell feature supports uplink and downlink sector carrier selection within the\n\nsame cell. In downlink, the feature supports selective muting of non-contributing sector\n\ncarriers for the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH), to reduce interference in\n\nneighboring cells. In uplink, if the UE is in an overlapping coverage area, the feature\n\nsupports macrodiversity on the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) to improve the uplink\n\ntransmissions.\n\nThe initial sector carrier selection for a UE is computed from\n\nthe relative powers of the random access preambles received at the\n\ndifferent sector carriers. After that, the received Physical Uplink\n\nControl Channel (PUCCH) Format 2 power measurements are used by the\n\neNodeB to determine the transmission and reception sector carriers\n\nrequired for each UE.\n\n## 3.1 Combination of Indoor and Outdoor Coverage\n\nFigure 2 provides an example of the use of the\n\nCombined Cell feature to improve radio performance in a combination of indoor and outdoor\n\nenvironments. Multiple sector carriers of the same combined cell are used to provide coverage\n\ninside the building and macro coverage outside the building.\n\nFigure 2   Example of Using Combined Cells in a Combination of Indoor\n\nand Outdoor Coverage Environments\n\nThe benefits of using the Combined Cell feature in this scenario\n\nare:\n\n- Seamless mobility on entering and leaving the building.\n- In coverage overlaps between sector carriers belonging to the same cell, an improved bit rate for a single UE can be expected compared to a single cell with a UE at cell border. The overlapping sector carriers provide a macrodiversity in this region.\n\n## 3.2 Indoor Coverage\n\nFigure 3 shows an example of the use\n\nof the Combined Cell feature to improve radio performance in an indoor\n\nenvironment. Multiple sector carriers of the same combined cell are\n\nused to provide indoor coverage to multiple floors of the same building.\n\nFigure 3   Example of Using Combined Cells in an Indoor Coverage Environment\n\nThe benefits of using the Combined Cell feature in this scenario\n\nare:\n\n- Seamless mobility between the floors of the building covered by the same combined cell.\n- In coverage overlaps between sector carriers belonging to the same cell, an improved bit rate for a single UE can be expected compared to a single cell with a UE at cell border. The overlapping sector carriers provide a macrodiversity in this region.\n\n## 3.3 NB-IoT Cell Coexistence with LTE Combined Cell\n\nAn in-band or guard band NB-IoT cell can exist in one sector of an LTE combined\n\ncell.\n\nOnly a combined cell with 2TX/2RX antenna configuration supports NB-IoT cell\n\ncoexistence.\n\nAn LTE combined cell with two sector carriers can have an in-band or guard band NB-IoT\n\ncell configured. The NB-IoT cell only uses one of the sector carriers of the host LTE\n\ncombined cell. The default value of NbIotCell.sectorCarrierRef is set\n\nto the first sector carrier of the host LTE combined cell. It is possible to manually\n\nset the NbIotCell.sectorCarrierRef to another cell. The attribute can\n\nonly be set to one of the sector carriers of the host LTE combined cell.\n\n### 3.3.1 Configure Sector Carrier of In-Band NB-IoT Cell\n\nFor the initial manual configuration, or the change of configuration of the sector\n\ncarrier of the in-band NB-IoT cell:\n\nSteps\n\n1. Lock the in-band cell.\n2. Lock the host cell.\n3. Set the NbIotCell.sectorCarrierRef attribute to one of the elements of the EUtranCellFDD.sectorCarrierRef list of the host cell.\n4. Unlock the host cell.\n5. Unlock the in-band cell.\n\n### 3.3.2 Configure Sector Carrier of Guard Band NB-IoT Cell\n\nFor the initial manual configuration, or the change of configuration of the sector\n\ncarrier of the guard band NB-IoT cell:\n\nSteps\n\n1. Lock the guard band cell.\n2. Lock the host cell.\n3. Set the NbIotCell.sectorCarrierRef attribute to one of the elements of the EUtranCellFDD.sectorCarrierRef list of the host cell.\n4. Unlock the host cell.\n5. Unlock the guard band cell.\n\n### 3.3.3 Validate Sector Carrier Configuration of Host LTE Cell\n\nWhen the configuration of the EUtranCellFDD.sectorCarrierRef\n\nattribute changes, it must be validated that the sector carriers for the LTE cell\n\ncontain the sector carrier for the NB-IoT in-band or guard band cell.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Set the EUtranCellFDD.sectorCarrierRef attribute. If the validation is successful, the EUtranCellFDD.sectorCarrierRef attribute is set successfully.\n\nIf validation fails, the following message is displayed: At least one\n\nsector attached to NB-IoT cell &lt;NbIotCell.cellId&gt; is not\n\nattached to the host cell\n\n&lt;EUtranCellFDD.cellId&gt;!\n\n&lt;NbIotCell.cellId&gt; refers to the cell ID of the NB-IoT cell.\n\n&lt;EUtranCellFDD.cellId&gt; refers to the cell ID of the host LTE\n\ncell.\n\nContinue with the following steps:\n\n2. Remove the NbIotCell.sectorCarrierRef attribute.\n3. Set the EUtranCellFDD.sectorCarrierRef attribute again and repeat the procedure until validation is successful.\n\n# 4 Network Impact of Combined Cell\n\nThe feature improves coverage and mobility.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThe Combined Cell feature extends the indoor and outdoor coverage areas within the same\n\ncell. The cell capacity of the combined cell is not impacted. A combined cell has the same\n\ncapacity as a cell that is not combined.\n\nNo neighbor relations need to be established between sector carriers of the same combined\n\ncell. This enables a reduction in the number of handovers.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.\n\n# 5 Parameters for Combined Cell\n\nThe feature introduces new and uses already existing MOM attributes.\n\nTable 2   Feature Description\n\n| Parameter                                   | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ENodeBFunction.combCellSectorSelectThreshRx | Introduced | See MOM description.

The thresholds are used to select only the sectors that are contributing to the                 quality of the call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| EUtranCellFDD.altitude                      | Affected   | If all sector carriers in a combined cell have the same output power, for example                 in indoor scenario or 3-sector site scenario, it is assumed that the antennas of                 different sector carriers are located close to each other.

Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011368 MO instance.\n\nAfter This Task\n\nKeep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.\n\n# 8 Deactivate Combined Cell\n\nIf the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual\n\nfeature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any\n\nconflicting feature.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nCCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4011368 MO instance.\n\nAfter This Task\n\nKeep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.\n\n# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Combined Cell\n\nEngineering guidelines for Combined Cell contain hardware configuration examples and\n\nfeature optimization.\n\n## 9.1 Feature Optimization\n\nPower measurements on PUCCH Format 2 containing CQI reports are needed to perform sector\n\nselection. Therefore, it is recommended that the value of\n\nEUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchCqiUsers and\n\nEUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchCqiUsers are set to no less than\n\nEUtranCellFDD.noOfPucchSrUsers and\n\nEUtranCellTDD.noOfPucchSrUsers to fully benefit from the Combined Cell\n\nfeature.\n\nFor those UEs that cannot be configured with PUCCH Format 2 resources, that is PUCCH CQI, the\n\nsector selection is only performed at Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH). These UEs are\n\nnot updated until the next random access procedure, due to the lack of PUCCH Format 2 power\n\nmeasurements.\n\n## 9.2 Hardware Configurations\n\nA given sector carrier can only be connected to one combined cell, it is not a possible\n\nconfiguration to connect it to multiple Combined Cells.\n\nExamples of hardware configurations using the Combined Cell feature are provided in the\n\nfollowing illustrations:\n\n- Figure 4\n- Figure 5\n- Figure 6\n- Figure 7\n- Figure 8\n- Figure 9\n- Figure 10\n\nFigure 4 provides an example configuration of one\n\ncombined cell with eight sector carriers, 2TX/2RX, cascaded radios.\n\nFigure 4   One Combined Cell with Eight Sector Carriers, 2TX/2RX, Cascaded Radios\n\nFigure 5 provides an example configuration of one\n\ncombined cell with eight sector carriers, 2TX/2RX, mixed configuration cascaded radios.\n\nFigure 5   One Combined Cell with Eight Sector Carriers, 2TX/2RX, Mixed Configuration Cascaded\n\nRadios\n\nFigure 6 shows an example configuration between two combined cells, one with\n\nthree sector carriers 2TX/RX, and one with four sectors 4TX/4RX, with cascaded radios.\n\nFigure 6   Two Combined Cells with Different Configurations\n\nFigure 7 shows an example configuration of one\n\ncombined cell with 12 sector carriers, 2TX/2RX, cascaded radios.\n\nFigure 7   One Combined Cell with 12 Sector Carriers, 2TX/2RX, Cascaded Radios\n\nFigure 8 shows an example configuration of one\n\ncombined cell with six sector carriers, 4TX/4RX.\n\nFigure 8   One Combined Cell with Six Sector Carriers, 4TX/4RX\n\nFigure 9   One Radio Gateway and a Combined Cell with Six Sector Carriers\n\nFigure 10   One LC-05 9xCPRI Line Card in Conversion Mode and a Combined Cell with Six Sector\n\nCarriers\n\nAn EUtranCell which has multiple sector carriers must have all sector carriers on RUs that\n\nare connected to the same Radio Gateway or LC-05 9xCPRI line card in conversion mode.\n\nFor more information about supported hardware configurations using the Combined Cell feature,\n\nsee Features for Radio Configurations.\n\n# Appendix A: Feature Change History\n\nThis section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the\n\nnetwork.\n\n## Appendix A.a: 20.Q2: Combined Cell with 24 Antennas\n\nThe enhancement enables combined cell support for up to 12 sectors and 24 antennas on\n\nBaseband Radio Nodes.\n\n| Feature Name:           | Combined Cell       |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3025        |\n| Value Package Name:     | Combined Cell       |\n| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0407        |\n| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node |\n| Access Type:            | LTE                 |\n\nBenefits\n\nThis feature enhancement provides support for 24 antenna branches and for the\n\nfollowing sector configurations:\n\n- Up to 12 sectors with two RX and two TX antennas\n- Up to six sectors with four RX and four TX antennas\n\nThe main benefits of this enhancement are the extended flexibility of combined cell\n\nconfiguration, and the reduced cell planning.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nCell coverage is extended because of the greater number of sectors.\n\nThe number of inter-cell handovers decreases because of the extended coverage.\n\nCell capacity is unaffected, but because more sectors share the same capacity, the\n\nmean sector capacity decreases.\n\nOperation\n\nNo impact.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nHardware\n\nNo special hardware requirements.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.\n\n## Appendix A.b: 19.Q2: Coexistence of NB-IoT and Combined Cell\n\nThis enhancement supports the use of NB-IoT in one dedicated cell that is involved in\n\nLTE Combined Cell deployment.\n\n| Feature Name:           | Combined Cell  NB-IoT Access                 |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3025  FAJ 121 4657                   |\n| Value Package Name:     | Combined Cell  M-IoT RAN on LTE Base Package |\n| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0407  FAJ 801 1000                   |\n| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node                          |\n| Access Type:            | LTE  MI                                      |\n\nBenefits\n\nAn NB-IoT cell can be configured in in-band or guard band deployment mode for an LTE\n\ncombined cell and carry the same benefits as an LTE combined cell. Only a combined\n\ncell with 2TX/2RX antenna configuration supports NB-IoT cell coexistence. The NB-IoT\n\ncell only uses one of the sector carriers of the host LTE combined cell.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nNo impact.\n\nOperation\n\nThe sector carrier used in the NB-IoT cell is configured statically by MOM.\n\nThe NbIotCell.sectorCarrierRef attribute is updated.

They also do not\n\nhave\n\na software license key associated, which means that they have no\n\nentries in the LKF that is installed on the node.\n\nIn some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured\n\nmanually or have some of\n\ntheir\n\nsubfunctions enabled to work properly.\n\n# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Mixed Bandwidth Support for Carrier Aggregation High-Band\n\nThe feature allows the operator to use a combination of bandwidths for carrier\n\naggregation (CA). As a result, higher peak throughput can be achieved.\n\nThe configuration and system behavior follow uplink and downlink CA. For more\n\ninformation, see the following documents:\n\n- NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation High-Band\n- NR 4CC DL Carrier Aggregation High-Band\n- NR 8CC DL Carrier Aggregation High-Band\n\nWhen using mixed bandwidth, for the best capacity and performance, it is recommended to\n\nconfigure the PSCell on the carrier with the highest available bandwidth.\n\nWhen selecting the supported band combinations, the following limitations must be\n\nconsidered:\n\n- The maximum spread in frequency for the selected band combination can be limited by the operational bandwidth of the radio.\n- The band combinations can be limited by how the combination can be placed on the PAAM segments.\n\nExample 1\n\nContiguous band combinations can be configured\n\nto form a non-contiguous band combination set on a radio type with two PAAM segments\n\nas shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1   Band Combinations Supported for PAAM Segments\n\nIn this example, band combination 2 must be allocated so that it occupies parts\n\nof two PAAM segments. The distance between PAAM 1 and PAAM 2 must not exceed the\n\nmaximum frequency spread for contiguous band combination sets defined in 3GPP\n\nTS 38.101-2. The reason for this is that the combined bandwidth and\n\nnecessary spacing for band combinations 1 and 2 exceeds the bandwidth for one PAAM\n\nsegment.\n\nThe following distance values cannot be less than the minimum\n\nfrequency spread between contiguous band combination sets specified in 3GPP TS\n\n38.101-2:\n\n- The distance between band combinations 1 and 2\n- The distance between band combinations 2 and 3\n\nIf possible, it is recommended to use the available spectrum so that no\n\nband combinations are allocated to both PAAM segments. In Figure 1, if band combination 3 is allocated\n\nin PAAM 1, and band combination 2 is allocated in PAAM 2, the two PAAM segments have\n\ndifferent frequencies, and a more scattered spectrum can be used.",

This functionality can be deactivated above a certain number of connected users per PSCell by the NRCellDU.maxUsersRachSchedPusch attribute.\n- In networks with low downlink traffic, by making use of unused PUCCH symbols for PUSCH, for the PSCell and SCell.\n\nPRACH symbols are configured for transmission of RACH \"msg1\" from the UE.\n\nRACH must be decoded in the following cases:\n\n- During SCG addition, on any wide beam. For an NSA solution, this is initiated by the F1 UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message from the MCG.\n- During scheduling request on RACH, on a specific wide beam. Scheduling request on RACH is a fallback mecahnism if the transmission of the periodic scheduling request on PUCCH is unsuccessful.Note: This can only happen in wide beams where the UEs are in poor radio channel quality conditions.\n\nIn TTIs where RACH decoding is not present, the gNodeB can schedule PUSCH on PRACH\n\nsymbols instead.\n\nIf there is only one connected user in the cell, and the PRACH symbols are scheduled\n\nas PUSCH, the scheduling request on PUCCH symbol is also used for scheduling PUSCH.\n\nIf there is little downlink traffic, PUCCH symbols are unused and can be used for\n\nscheduling PUSCH transmissions.\n\nIf the Extended Propagation Delay Support High-Band feature is activated, the Optimized\n\nUplink Peak Throughput High-Band feature supports cell ranges up to 14,000 m.\n\nRelated Information\n\nExtended Propagation Delay Support High-Band\n\n# 4 Network Impact of Optimized Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band\n\nWhen the feature is activated, an increase in uplink throughput can be\n\nexpected.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThe feature enables increased uplink throughput, but this improvement decreases\n\ngradually as the number of connected users and the amount of traffic activity\n\nincreases.\n\nNo performance impact is expected on RACH and PUCCH.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.\n\n# 5 Parameters for Optimized Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band\n\nAn attribute is introduced to configure the maximum number of connected users for\n\nscheduling PUSCH on RACH symbols.\n\nTable 2   Parameters\n\n| Parameter                       | Type       | Description          |\n|---------------------------------|------------|----------------------|\n| NRCellDU.maxUsersRachSchedPusch | Introduced | See MOM description. |\n\n# 6 Performance of Optimized Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band\n\nThis feature introduces PM counters and updates an event.\n\nKPIs\n\nThe gNodeB Contention-Based Random Access Success Rate is expected to be increased\n\nbecause of the decreased number of Random Access preambles.\n\nCounters\n\nThe following PM counters are introduced to track the number of PUCCH and RACH\n\nsymbols that are used for PUSCH:\n\n- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymRachSchedPusch\n- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymPucchSchedPusch\n\nEvents\n\nThe DuPerCellResourceRep event is updated with two event\n\nparameters for the following reasons:\n\n- To track the aggregated number of resource block symbols where PSCell is configured for RACH but the symbols are used for scheduling on PUSCH.\n- To track the aggregated number of resource block symbols in uplink slots where PSCell is configured for PUCCH but the symbols are used for scheduling on PUSCH.\n\n# 7 Activate Optimized Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band\n\nTo use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation\n\nprocedure.\n\nPrerequisites\n\n- The license key is installed in the node.\n- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Set the attribute featureState to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012535 MO instance.\n\nAfter This Task\n\nKeep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.\n\n# 8 Deactivate Optimized Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band\n\nIf the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual\n\nfeature deactivation procedure. It must also be deactivated before the activation of any\n\nconflicting feature.\n\nPrerequisites\n\n- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Set the attribute featureState to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012535 MO instance.\n\nAfter This Task\n\nKeep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.\n\n# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Optimized Uplink Peak Throughput High-Band\n\nThe NRCellDU.maxUsersRachSchedPusch MO limits the use of RACH\n\nsymbols as PUSCH during high load.\n\nDuring high traffic load (and many connected UEs), there is an increased probability of\n\nUEs attempting to request uplink grant through scheduling request on RACH. This might\n\nhappen at the same time as the symbols are scheduled for PUSCH. To minimize this risk,\n\nthe NRCellDU.maxUsersRachSchedPusch attribute explicitly limits the\n\nuse of RACH symbols as PUSCH during high load.",

This can increase the                         relevance of the received notifications and reduce the number of alarms and                         alerts sent from the Baseband Radio Node. |\n|                                  |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Automatic recoveries             |    | Whenever a fault occurs, the system is trying to recover the failed resource                         unless it is evaluated as a non-recoverable problem that requires operator                         intervention. For example:  detection of suspected sleeping cells based on the radio carrier                                     power levels, and the cell resetup triggered automatically as a                                     recovery mechanism.

The feature supports the configuration of mixed TDD patterns\n\nacross up to three capacity modules. The cells in a capacity module must be\n\nconfigured with the same TDD pattern. The following TDD patterns are supported in\n\nthe SpCell and SCells:\n\n- DDDSUDDSUU with 10:2:2 special slot configuration\n- DDDDDDDSUU with 6:4:4 special slot configuration\n\nThe SpCell can be TDD or FDD.\n\nThe feature requires at least two TDD cells, but the other cells can be FDD.\n\nThe feature is supported in NR standalone and EN-DC deployments.\n\nThe feature provides the following benefits:\n\n- More flexibility in deployment\n- More efficient use of the scattered spectrum\n\nAdditional Information\n\nFor more information and related topics, see the following documentation:\n\n- 3GPP TS 38.101-1; NR; User Equipment (UE) Radio Transmission and Reception; Part 1: Range 1 Standalone\n- 3GPP TS 38.101-3; NR; User Equipment (UE) Radio Transmission and Reception; Part 3: Range 1 and Range 2 Interworking Operation with Other Radios\n- 3GPP TS 38.213; NR; Physical Layer Procedures for Control\n- 3GPP TS 38.306; NR; User Equipment (UE) Radio Access Capabilities\n- 3GPP TS 38.321; NR; Medium Access Control (MAC) Protocol Specification\n- 3GPP TS 38.331; NR; Radio Resource Control (RRC) Protocol Specification\n\n# 2 Dependencies of Mixed TDD Pattern Support for DL Carrier Aggregation\n\nThe feature uses E5 link connectivity and at least one of the downlink carrier\n\naggregation features must be enabled.

Configuring two capacity modules that use FDD duplex mode in one gNodeB-DU is not possible.\n- TDD cells in the same capacity module must be configured with the same TDD pattern.\n\nExample 1   Configuration Examples of Two Capacity Modules in\n\nOne gNodeB\n\nFigure 1   Configuration Example of Two Capacity Modules in One gNodeB\n\nFigure 2   Configuration Example of Two Capacity Modules in One gNodeB\n\nExample 2   Configuration Example of Two Capacity Modules in\n\nTwo gNodeBs\n\nFigure 3   Configuration Example of Two Capacity Modules in Two gNodeBs\n\nExample 3   Configuration Example of Three Capacity Modules in\n\nTwo gNodeBs\n\nFigure 4   Configuration Example of Three Capacity Modules in Two gNodeBs\n\nExample 4   Configuration Example of Three Capacity Modules in\n\nThree gNodeBs\n\nFigure 5   Configuration Example of Three Capacity Modules in Three gNodeBs\n\n# 4 Network Impact of Mixed TDD Pattern Support for DL Carrier Aggregation\n\nThe feature improves cell utilization.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThe feature provides deployment flexibility through supporting network deployments\n\nwith two different TDD patterns on different cells. As a result, cell utilization\n\nmight improve, because downlink data transmission is distributed across component\n\ncarriers of different TDD patterns.\n\nIn sectors with high downlink data demand from multiple UEs that actively use three\n\nor more component carriers where some or all of them are external, UE throughput\n\nmight decrease. The UE throughput decrease occurs by reaching the reservation limits\n\non the PDCCH and PUCCH.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.\n\n# 5 Parameters for Mixed TDD Pattern Support for DL Carrier Aggregation\n\nConfiguration changes are required for additional PUCCH resource\n\nallocation.\n\nTable 4   Parameters\n\n# 6 Performance of Mixed TDD Pattern Support for DL Carrier Aggregation\n\nThe performance of the feature can be observed through downlink cell throughput KPIs,\n\nRIs, PIs, and downlink cell volume counters.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nTable 5   Key Performance Indicators\n\n| KPI                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                          |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Average DL MAC DRB Throughput                                 | Downlink DRB throughput might increase because of the higher data                                     rates from carrier aggregation-capable UEs.(1) |\n| DL MAC DRB Throughput per QoS                                 | Downlink DRB throughput might increase because of the higher data                                     rates from carrier aggregation-capable UEs.(1) |\n| Normalized Average DL MAC Cell Throughput considering traffic | This KPI might increase because of the higher data rates from                                     carrier aggregation-capable UEs.                   |\n\n(1)\n\nSubject to the traffic patterns in the network.\n\nFor more information on KPIs, see Key Performance Indicators.\n\nResource Indicators\n\nTable 6   Resource Indicator\n\n| RI                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| UL CA Partition Utilization | When carrier aggregation partition is configured, the feature impacts the                 uplink carrier aggregation SCell partition utilization, which is monitored by this                 RI.

Each source cell determines the amount of traffic\n\nload that is handed over to each target cell, to balance the load differences.\n\nThe load balancing is triggered as soon as relatively low enough load is reported from\n\nneighbor cells. Signaling and UE measurements are ordered even though the load in source\n\ncell is low.\n\nWith this feature IFLB is triggered towards a target cell only if:\n\n- The load in source cell is above the pre-configured load threshold for the target frequency cell.\n- The load difference is larger than the pre-configured load difference threshold.\n\nExample 1   Load Balancing Between Cells with\n\nDifferent Thresholds\n\n| Inter-frequency Load Balancing is triggered to target cell 1     |    | If the load in the serving cell is greater than the frequency based load                             threshold corresponding to the frequency of target cell 1 plus the                             pre-configured minimum load difference.   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                  |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Inter-frequency Load Balancing is not triggered to target cell 2 |    | If the load in the serving cell is smaller than the frequency based load                             threshold corresponding to the frequency of target cell 2 plus the                             pre-configured minimum load difference.   |\n\n# 4 Network Impact of IFLB Activation Threshold\n\nIFLB action is not triggered to a target frequency cell if the load in source cell is\n\nbelow the pre-configured load threshold.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThe feature reduces the UE measurements and handovers for IFLB.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.\n\n# 5 Parameters for IFLB Activation Threshold\n\nThe IFLB Activation Threshold feature introduces a parameter to set the minimum\n\ntarget cell load for a defined carrier frequency.\n\nTable 2   Parameters\n\n| Parameter                                | Type       | Description          |\n|------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------|\n| EUtranFreqRelation.lbActivationThreshold | Introduced | See MOM description. |\n\n# 6 Performance of IFLB Activation Threshold\n\nThere are no associated KPIs, counters and events to this feature.\n\n# 7 Activate IFLB Activation Threshold\n\nTo use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation\n\nprocedure.\n\nPrerequisites\n\n- The license key is installed in the node.\n- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.\n- The Inter-Frequency Load Balancing feature is activated on the node.\n\nSteps\n\n1.

A spatial null in the radiation pattern is an\n\narea in which the EIRP is reduced.\n\nThe following characteristics of a spatial null can be configured:\n\n| Spatial Null Characteristics   | Configurable Parameters                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Affected DL channels           | NRSectorCarrier.nullSteeringMode                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Frequency                      | frequency member of the                                         NRSectorCarrier.elevationNull or the                                         NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull attributes(1)                                      |\n| Null width                     | nullWidth member of the                                         NRSectorCarrier.elevationNull or the                                         NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull                                     attributes     |\n| Horizontal angle               | horizontalAngle member of the                                         NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull attribute                                                                                                                 |\n| Vertical angle                 | verticalAngle member of the                                         NRSectorCarrier.elevationNull or the                                         NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull                                     attributes |\n\n(1)\n\nIf a null is configured for a certain frequency, the\n\ndirection might slightly change for adjacent\n\nfrequencies. By default, the value of the\n\nfrequency member is 0 and the\n\nnull is applied for the center frequency of the\n\ncarrier.\n\nDirection of the Configured Nulls\n\nAs Figure 1 shows, the following angles can\n\nbe used to describe the direction of the configured nulls:\n\n| verticalAngle (θ)   |    | The vertical angle relative to the transverse plane passing through                                 the center of the antenna array. Shown as theta angle. Positive                                 values cause the null to be aimed downward and negative values cause                                 the null to be aimed upward.   |\n|---------------------|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                     |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| horizontalAngle (φ) |    | The horizontal angle relative to the sagittal plane passing through                                 the center of the antenna array. Shown as phi angle. Looking from                                 above, positive values aim the null clockwise and negative values                                 aim the null counterclockwise.  |\n\nFigure 1   Angles Shown in a 3D Coordinate System\n\nIn vertical null steering, a null configured for a certain\n\nverticalAngle value is applicable for all\n\nhorizontalAngle values. This is why the\n\nhorizontalAngle member is absent from the\n\nNRSectorCarrier.elevationNull attribute. Figure 2 shows a single elevation null at\n\nverticalAngle = 5\n\nFigure 2   Radiation Pattern Heat Map with a Single Vertical Null\n\nIn horizontal null steering, a null configured for a certain\n\nhorizontalAngle value is not always applicable for every\n\nverticalAngle value. If observed in theta and phi surface,\n\nas shown in Figure 3, horizontal null\n\nsteering generates an azimuth null with a circle-like shape that goes through the\n\nintersection of the configured verticalAngle and\n\nhorizontalAngle. The only exception in horizontal null\n\nsteering is when horizontalAngle = 0. In this case, a null\n\nstrip is generated in the center of the radiation pattern, which is the broadside\n\ndirection of the antenna array.\n\nAt least 30 degrees of separation is required between two null directions to have\n\nreasonable coverage between the two nulls.\n\nAs an example, Figure 3 shows the following\n\nnulls:\n\n- Azimuth nulls: (verticalAngle, horizontalAngle) = (0, 0) (verticalAngle, horizontalAngle) = (40, 20) (verticalAngle, horizontalAngle) = (10, −40)\n- Elevation null: verticalAngle = 0\n\nThe width of the nulls is configured to NARROW in the\n\nnullWidth member of the corresponding\n\nNRSectorCarrier.elevationNull and\n\nNRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull attributes.\n\nFigure 3   Radiation Pattern Heat Map with Four Generated Nulls\n\nThe following null characteristics can be observed in the example given in Figure 3:\n\n- The generated elevation null at verticalAngle = 0 is available for all horizontalAngle values.\n- The generated azimuth null at horizontalAngle = 0 is available for all verticalAngle values.\n- The generated azimuth nulls at (verticalAngle, horizontalAngle) = (40, 20) and (verticalAngle, horizontalAngle) = (10, −40) are not available at all verticalAngle values. These are nulls with circle-like shapes that pass through the configured direction.\n\n# 4 Network Impact of Directional Interference Mitigation\n\nThe feature can affect the cell throughput and the number of handovers in the\n\ncell.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nEIRP is reduced towards the null direction on selected downlink channels based on MO\n\nconfiguration. This can cause the following effects:\n\n- Cell throughput can be reduced because of the generated null.\n- The number of handovers might increase in cells with one or more configured nulls.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.\n\n# 5 Parameters for Directional Interference Mitigation\n\nThe feature introduces attributes to configure the null characteristics. Attributes\n\nthat control beamforming can affect the feature\n\nconfiguration.\n\nTable 1   Parameters\n\n| Parameter                              | Type       | Description                                                                                    |\n|----------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull            | Introduced | See MOM description.                                                                           |\n| NRSectorCarrier.elevationNull          | Introduced | See MOM description.                                                                           |\n| NRSectorCarrier.nullSteeringMode       | Introduced | See MOM description.                                                                           |\n| CommonBeamforming.coverageShape        | Affecting  | To use the feature, this attribute must be set to                                     MACRO_1. |\n| CommonBeamforming.customComBfwWideBeam | Affecting  | To use the feature, this attribute must be empty.                                              |\n\n# 6 Performance of Directional Interference Mitigation\n\nThe feature has no associated KPIs, counters, and\n\nevents.\n\nKPIs\n\nThis feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators.\n\nCounters\n\nThis feature has no directly associated counters.\n\nEvents\n\nThis feature has no associated events.\n\n# 7 Activate Directional Interference Mitigation\n\nTo use the feature, it must be activated following the usual feature activation\n\nprocedure, then the relevant attributes must be configured.\n\nPrerequisites\n\n- The license key is installed in the node.\n- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to ACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012536 MO instance.\n2. Configure the NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull, the NRSectorCarrier.elevationNull, or both attributes.\n3. If applicable, configure the NRSectorCarrier.nullSteeringMode attribute.\n\nAfter This Task\n\n- Keep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.\n\n# 8 Deactivate Directional Interference Mitigation\n\nIf the feature is no longer needed, it can be deactivated following the usual feature\n\ndeactivation procedure. The relevant attributes must be set to empty.\n\nPrerequisites\n\n- CCTR is active for at least one week before this procedure to collect enough troubleshooting data.\n\nSteps\n\n1. The NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull and the NRSectorCarrier.elevationNull attributes must be set to empty.\n2. Set the attribute FeatureState.featureState to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4012536 MO instance.\n\nAfter This Task\n\nKeep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.\n\n# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Directional Interference Mitigation\n\nCertain criteria must be met during configuration.\n\nThe following guidelines must be followed when configuring the feature:\n\n- If applicable, the CommonBeamforming.coverageShape attribute must be set to MACRO\\_1 and the CommonBeamforming.customComBfwWideBeam attribute must be set to empty.\n- The maximum allowed number of configured NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull attributes is three and the maximum allowed configured NRSectorCarrier.elevationNull attributes is one. This is to limit the degradation of the radiation pattern. The degrees of freedom of the available antenna ports can further limit the number of configurable nulls.\n- When setting a horizontal null, the value of the horizontalAngle member of the NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull attribute must be set between −60 and 60. However, the recommendation is to set the value between −45 and 45 to reduce the chance of generating an unwanted null in the radiation pattern.\n- At least 30 degrees of separation is required between two null directions to have reasonable coverage between the two nulls.\n\n## 9.1 Antenna Degrees of Freedom\n\nThe degrees of freedom in each direction of the antenna array limit the number of\n\nphysical nulls the antenna can generate.\n\nThe number of generated physical nulls is not always equal to the number of the\n\nconfigured NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull or\n\nNRSectorCarrier.elevationNull attributes.\n\nThe number of the generated physical nulls depends on the setting of the\n\nnullWidth member of the corresponding\n\nNRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull or\n\nNRSectorCarrier.elevationNull attributes. For certain values,\n\nmore than one adjacent physical nulls are generated. Table 2 shows the actual number of the physical\n\nnulls generated with different configurations:\n\nTable 2   Number of Physical Nulls Generated for Each Configuration\n\n| nullWidth Value   | Width   |   Number of Generated Physical Nulls |\n|-------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|\n| <0>               | NARROW  |                                    1 |\n| <1>               | MEDIUM  |                                    2 |\n| <2>               | WIDE    |                                    3 |\n\nThe maximum number of physical nulls is influenced by the following characteristics:\n\n- The number of ports in the azimuth and elevation axes of the given antenna array\n- The setting of the nullSteeringMode attribute\n\nTable 3   Calculating the Maximum Number of Allowed Physical Nulls on Each Axis\n\n|   nullSteeringMode Value | Null Steering Mode   | Maximum Number of Physical Horizontal Nulls                                                                                                                        | Maximum Number of Physical Vertical Nulls                                                                                                                                                            |\n|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                        0 | ALL                  | The lowest number of the COMMON_BEAMFORMING and the                                     CSI_RS_MAPPING mode calculations                                           | The lowest number of the COMMON_BEAMFORMING and the                                     CSI_RS_MAPPING mode calculations                                                                             |\n|                        1 | COMMON_BEAMFORMING   | (number of ports on the azimuth axis in the antenna array) − 1                                                                                                     | (number of ports on the elevation axis in the antenna array) − 1                                                                                                                                     |\n|                        2 | CSI_RS_MAPPING       | (number of ports on the azimuth axis in the antenna array) / (N1                                 value of the CSI-RS port codebook configuration setting) − 1  (1) | (number of ports on the elevation axis in the antenna array) / (N2                                 value of the CSI-RS port codebook configuration setting) −                                 1  (1) |\n\n(1)\n\nThe N1 and N2 values depend on the current configuration of the\n\nNRCellDU.CsiRsConfig*P attribute. For more information on CSI-RS\n\nconfigurations, see Manage Massive MIMO NR.\n\nFor example, Figure 4 shows an antenna array that\n\nhas ports ranging from port 0 to port 7 on the azimuth axis and ports ranging from port\n\n0 to port 3 on the elevation axis. In this case, the maximum allowed number of generated\n\nphysical azimuth nulls is seven and the maximum allowed number of generated physical\n\nelevation nulls is three.\n\nFigure 4   Example Antenna Array\n\nThe following examples show configurations that are allowed with the antenna array shown\n\nin Figure 4 with the\n\nnullSteeringMode member configured to\n\nCOMMON\\_BEAMFORMING:\n\n- Three NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull attributes with NARROW settings: Nulls with NARROW setting generate one physical null for each MO attribute. This configuration is allowed because 1 + 1 + 1 ≤ 7.\n- Two NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull attributes with MEDIUM settings: Nulls with MEDIUM setting generate two physical nulls for each MO attribute and nulls with WIDE setting generate three physical nulls per MO attribute. This configuration is allowed because 2 + 2 ≤ 7.\n\nThe following example shows a configuration that is not allowed with an antenna array\n\nshown in Figure 4:\n\n- Three NRSectorCarrier.azimuthNull attributes with WIDE settings: Nulls with WIDE setting generate three physical nulls for each MO attribute. This configuration is not allowed because 3 + 3 + 3 &gt; 7.\n\nElevation Null Interaction with Digital Tilt\n\nIf an antenna does not have enough degrees of freedom on the elevation axis, the\n\npreviously configured digital tilt is not preserved when an elevation null is\n\napplied.\n\nFor example, AIR 3239 has two subarrays on the elevation axis and therefore it has\n\none degree of freedom in elevation. This means that even if a\n\nNARROW elevation null is applied to this antenna, the radiation\n\npattern with the null overrides the previously configured digital tilt and the\n\ndigital tilt is lost.\n\nHowever, if the antenna has enough degrees of freedom on the elevation axis, the\n\npreviously configured digital tilt is preserved when an elevation null is applied.\n\nFor example, AIR 6449 has four subarrays on the elevation axis and therefore it has\n\nthree degrees of freedom in elevation. This means that if a NARROW elevation null is\n\napplied to this antenna, the previously configured digital tilt is preserved.\n\n## 9.2 Pattern File Examples for AIR 3239 B78G\n\nThe following test cases show radiation patterns and traffic envelopes that are based on\n\nmeasured data.\n\nTable 4 shows the generated nulls and the\n\navailable CSI-RS 8P configurations for every given example.\n\nTable 4   Details of Each Test Case\n\n| Example ID   | Configured Azimuth Nulls   | Configured Elevation Nulls   | Common Beam   | CSI-RS 8P 2x2   | CSI-RS 8P 4x1   | Vertical Tilt Angle(1)   |\n|--------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| Example 1    | 0° NARROW                  | N/A                          | Yes           | Yes             | Yes             | 6°                       |\n| Example 2    | 0° MEDIUM                  | N/A                          | Yes           | Yes             | N/A             | 6°                       |\n| Example 3    | 0° WIDE                    | N/A                          | Yes           | Yes             | N/A             | 6°                       |\n| Example 4    | 45° NARROW  −25° NARROW    | N/A                          | Yes           | Yes             | N/A             | 6°                       |\n| Example 5    | 45° NARROW  −25° MEDIUM    | N/A                          | Yes           | Yes             | N/A             | 6°                       |\n| Example 6    | N/A                        | 0° NARROW                    | Yes           | N/A             | Yes             | 6°                       |\n| Example 7    | 45° NARROW                 | 0° NARROW                    | Yes           | N/A             | Yes             | 6°                       |\n\n(1)\n\nThe digital tilt can be configured in the\n\nCommonBeamforming.digitalTilt\n\nattribute\n\n.\n\nExample 1\n\nThe following image shows the gain normalized\n\npattern file for common beam:\n\nThe following images\n\nshow the service beams and corresponding envelopes for CSI-RS 8P 2x2\n\nconfiguration:\n\nThe following images\n\nshow the service beams and corresponding envelopes for CSI-RS 8P 4x1\n\nconfiguration:\n\nExample 2\n\nThe following image shows the gain normalized\n\npattern file for common beam:\n\nThe following images\n\nshow the service beams and corresponding envelopes for CSI-RS 8P 2x2\n\nconfiguration:\n\nExample 3\n\nThe following image shows the gain normalized\n\npattern file for common beam:\n\nThe following images\n\nshow the service beams and corresponding envelopes for CSI-RS 8P 2x2\n\nconfiguration:\n\nExample 4\n\nThe following image shows the gain normalized\n\npattern file for common beam:\n\nThe following images\n\nshow the service beams and corresponding envelopes for CSI-RS 8P 2x2\n\nconfiguration:\n\nExample 5\n\nThe following image shows the gain normalized\n\npattern file for common beam:\n\nThe following images\n\nshow the service beams and corresponding envelopes for CSI-RS 8P 2x2\n\nconfiguration:\n\nExample 6\n\nThe following images show the gain normalized\n\npattern files for common beam:\n\nThe following images show the service beams and corresponding envelopes for\n\nCSI-RS 8P 4x1 configuration:\n\nExample 7\n\nThe following images show the gain normalized\n\npattern files for common beam:\n\nThe following images show the service beams and corresponding envelopes for\n\nCSI-RS 8P 4x1 configuration:\n\n## 9.3 Configure Azimuth Null\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe license key must be installed and the feature must be activated on the node.\n\nSteps\n\n1.

When the feature is active, the UE can be directed to\n\ntransfer from the LTE network to the CDMA-eHRPD network while maintaining the data\n\nsession.\n\n| Feature Name           | Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity                         |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 0491                                                             |\n| Value Package Name     | LTE Base Package                                                         |\n| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 0400                                                             |\n| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                      |\n| Access Type            | LTE                                                                      |\n| Licensing              | License-controlled feature. One license is required for each radio node. |\n\nSummary\n\nThis feature manages the redirection of UEs in RRC\\_CONNECTED\n\nmode to another network when the UE measures poor coverage in the current LTE\n\nfrequency. Redirection is controlled by the network and triggered by UE measurement\n\nreports of the serving LTE cell.\n\nThe feature provides system information about alternative networks that can be used\n\nby a UE in RRC\\_IDLE mode for cell reselection.\n\nIf no session continuity feature is activated, the UE is configured not to trigger\n\nmeasurements of poor coverage. Instead, the UE remains connected to the original\n\nfrequency within the LTE network with poor LTE coverage. If the UE is eventually\n\nreleased, it is required to perform idle mode cell reselection to move to another\n\nnetwork. This interruption time is long if the UE is connected to the LTE frequency\n\nwith poor coverage for a long period while another network can provide better\n\nquality.\n\nThis feature has the following benefits:\n\n- Network capacity is improved because the UE is served by the best available RAT.\n- Service performance for an individual UE is increased by improving the possibility that the UE is served by the best available RAT.\n- Session transition to another network is possible with reduced interruptions to data flows during the transition process.\n- Idle mode transition to another network is facilitated by the transmission of SIB broadcast messages.\n- Off-loading is possible by configuring coverage thresholds.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nFor information on the preferred state and parameter settings of this feature,\n\nsee RAN Parameter Recommendations Lists.\n\nMore information about this feature and related topics can be found in the\n\nfollowing documentation:\n\n- 3GPP TS 36.300 Overall description; Stage 2\n- 3GPP TS 36.304 User Equipment (UE) procedures in idle mode\n- 3GPP TS 36.331 Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol Specification\n- FDD only: Dynamic SCell Selection for Carrier Aggregation\n\n# 2 Dependencies of Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity\n\nThe Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity feature is related to the other\n\nsession continuity features and features related to handover.\n\nTable 1   Feature Dependencies\n\nHardware\n\nNo special hardware requirement for this feature.\n\nLimitations\n\nNo limitations for this feature.\n\nNetwork Requirements\n\nNo network requirements for this feature.\n\n# 3 Feature Operation of Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity\n\nThe Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity feature redirects UEs to a\n\nCDMA-eHRPD network if the serving cell coverage becomes worse than the threshold and the\n\nCDMA-eHRPD cell coverage becomes good enough.\n\nThis feature uses the A2 measurement process. The A2 measurement is when the serving\n\ncell coverage becomes worse than the threshold, as defined in the following standard\n\nspecifications:\n\n- 3GPP TS 36.300\n- 3GPP TS 36.331\n\nThe UE uses the measurement parameters sent by the serving eNodeB for the measurement\n\nprocess to evaluate the serving cell. These parameters sent to the UE in the\n\nRRCConnectionReconfiguration messages include the following\n\ninformation:\n\n- Threshold values\n- Hysteresis values\n- Measurement filtering\n- Time-to-trigger parameters\n\nThe time-to-trigger parameters are included in the evaluation to prevent redirection\n\nto another network based on a small number of measurements taken during a rapid fade\n\nin the radio link. Hysteresis is used for protection against re-triggering A2 measurement\n\nand triggering unnecessary UE measurement report transmissions.\n\nThe UE measurements are reported to the serving eNodeB to make the final decision on\n\nredirection to another network.\n\nThe A2 measurement can base its triggering criterion on the following measurements:\n\n| RSRP   |    | Indicates the mean measured power per reference signal.                                                        |\n|--------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|        |    |                                                                                                                |\n| RSRQ   |    | Indicates the reference signal quality, for example, high inter                             cell-interference. |\n\nThe eNodeB configures two A2 measurements in the UE to detect poor coverage.\n\nOne of them is based on RSRP and one of them is based on RSRQ using the default\n\nsettings. The eNodeB considers a UE to be in poor coverage when at least one of the\n\nmeasurements report poor coverage.\n\nThe eNodeB uses the following criteria to determine whether\n\nto release the UE with a redirection to another network:\n\n- UE capabilities\n- eNodeB licenses\n- Redirection priority\n\nIf the UE is released with a redirection to a CDMA-eHRPD network, the release message\n\ncontains information about one or several CDMA-eHRPD frequencies to help the UE find a\n\nsuitable CDMA-eHRPD cell.\n\n## 3.1 Feature Operation Sequence Diagram\n\nThe following Coverage-Triggered Session Continuity features operate the same way:\n\n- Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Session Continuity\n- Coverage-Triggered GERAN Session Continuity\n- Coverage-Triggered WCDMA Session Continuity\n- Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity\n- TDD only: Coverage-Triggered TD-SCDMA Session Continuity\n\nTo understand how these interact when several or all of theses features are operational,\n\nthe description here covers all of them.\n\nFigure 1   How and Where to Transfer the UE at Poor Coverage\n\nOperational process:\n\n1. The UE connects to the cell.\n2. The eNodeB determines a set of frequencies for LTE or IRAT, where the UE is transferred when it encounters poor coverage in the current cell.\n    1. The eNodeB searches all frequency relations in the following MO instances for the corresponding RAT: Frequency Relation MO Corresponding RAT EUtranFreqRelation LTE GeranFreqGroupRelation GERAN UtranFreqRelation WCDMA Cdma2000FreqBandRelation CDMA-eHRPD UtranTDDFreqRelation TD-SCDMA The following criteria has to be fulfilled for the eNodeB to find a frequency relation:\n        - The corresponding Coverage-Triggered Session Continuity feature is active and enabled. The corresponding frequency relation MO instance is included only, if the corresponding Coverage-Triggered Session Continuity feature is activated and enabled.\n        - The frequency of the serving cell is not represented, so the EUtranFreqRelation for the frequency of the serving cell is not included.\n        - The UE is capable to operate on the frequency.\n        - If the Shared LTE RAN feature is operable, more selection criteria are used.\n        - If the Subscriber Triggered Mobility feature is operable, more selection criteria are used.\n    2. Construct the following two sets from the set found at step 2.a: A set where all frequency relations with the attribute connectedModeMobilityPrio set to -1 are excluded. A set where all frequency relations with the attribute voicePrio set to -1 are excluded.\n3. If coverage provided by the serving cell drops below the parameter-defined threshold for poor coverage, the UE is configured to send an A2 measurement report, if at least one of the sets of frequencies found is not empty.\n4. If the UE encounters poor coverage, the A2 measurement is triggered in the UE and it sends a measurement report to the eNodeB. The eNodeB selects the candidate frequency relations with the highest priority from the set of frequencies found at step 2.a. The priorities are determined using priority attributes on the frequency relation MOs: If the UE has an active voice bearer (with QCI 1) The attribute voicePrio is used. Frequency relation MOs which does not have this attribute are ignored. If the UE has no active voice bearer (with QCI 1) The attribute connectedModeMobilityPrio is used. If the selected priority attribute has a -1 value All frequency relations are omitted. Several frequency relation MOs share the highest value for these attributes They are all selected. The set is empty because no frequency relation is selected The eNodeB continues to wait for another A2 measurement report from the UE.\n5. The eNodeB first checks if a blind handover to a predefined cell is possible. This is enabled by the following handover features: Note: Only cells using a candidate frequency found at step 4 are considered for blind handover.\n    - SRVCC Handover to GERAN\n    - SRVCC Handover to UTRAN\n    - Coverage-Triggered WCDMA IRAT Handover\n    - Coverage-Triggered Inter-Frequency Handover\n6. Measurements are started if the UeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActive attribute is true and the candidate frequencies selected at step 4 contain at least one frequency which can be measured. A frequency can be measured, if the following criteria are fulfilled:\n    - The UE supports measurements on the frequency.\n    - The eNodeB supports measurements on the frequency. Note: The eNodeB supports measurements on all LTE and GERAN frequencies. The eNodeB supports measurements on WCDMA, CDMA-eHRPD, and TD-SCDMA (TDD only) frequencies only, if there are configured cells for these frequencies with the MO instances of UtranCellRelation and Cdma2000CellRelation.\n7. If measurements are not started, and the UE does not have an active bearer with QCI 1 or the value of the parameter UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 is true, the eNodeB initiates a release with redirect to one of the selected frequencies. These are all on the same priority level, so the eNodeB can pick any one of them. It is unspecified which one the eNodeB picks, but given the same selection of frequencies, the eNodeB always picks the same frequency. If measurements are not started, but the UE has an active bearer with QCI 1, and the value of the parameter UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 is false, the eNodeB waits for another A2 measurement report.\n8. If measurements are started, the eNodeB starts A5 measurement or A3 measurements for LTE frequencies and B2 measurements for IRAT frequencies to detect the candidate frequencies selected at step 4 that can be measured as described in step 6. The eNodeB also starts A1 measurements to detect if the UE moves into good coverage again. At the same time the eNodeB starts the timer UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer.\n9. If an A1 measurement report arrives from the UE, the eNodeB stops the A5 measurement, A3 measurement, B2 measurement and A1 measurements in the UE, and waits for another A2 measurement report.\n10. If the UeMeasControl.a5B2MobilityTimer times out and the UE does not have an active bearer with QCI 1 (indicating a voice bearer), or the value of the UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 attribute is true, the eNodeB releases the UE with a redirection to one of the frequencies for which A5 measurement, A3 measurement, or B2 measurements starts at step 8. If the UE has an active bearer with QCI 1, the eNodeB restarts the timer and waits for another measurement report for the A5 measurement, A3 measurement, B2 measurement, or A1 measurement.\n11. An A5 measurement report, A3 measurement report, or B2 measurement report arrives from the UE for one of the frequencies\n12. The eNodeB first checks if a handover is possible to one of the reported cells. This is enabled by separate handover features.\n13. If the UE does not have an active bearer with QCI 1 (indicating a voice bearer), or the value of the parameter UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 is true, the eNodeB initiates a release with redirect to the frequency of the measurement report. If the UE has an active bearer with QCI 1, and the value of the parameter UeMeasControl.allowReleaseQci1 is false, the eNodeB waits for another measurement report for the A5 measurement, A3 measurement, B2 measurement, or A1 measurement.\n\n## 3.2 Measurement Configuration\n\nB2 Measurement\n\nA B2 measurement is when the serving cell becomes worse than absolute threshold1 and the\n\nneighbor cell becomes better than another absolute threshold2. B2 measurement is the\n\nmeasurement criterion for finding suitable alternative CDMA-eHRPD frequencies.\n\nAll CDMA-eHRPD frequencies selected by the frequency selection algorithm uses the\n\nsame configuration for the B2 measurement.\n\nA1 Measurement\n\nA1 measurement is the measurement criterion for detecting that the UE moves out of poor\n\ncoverage and no longer has to be transferred to a new frequency. The eNodeB configures two\n\nA1 measurement measurements in the UE, and these have to correspond to the two A2\n\nmeasurements for poor coverage. The parameters of the ReportConfigA1Prim\n\nand ReportConfigA1Sec MO are used for the configuration of A1\n\nmeasurements.\n\nA2 Measurement\n\nThe poor coverage evaluation can use primary and secondary measurement parameters to allow\n\nthe UE to use different settings for two simultaneous measurements for A2 measurement. Primary\n\nmeasurements use RSRP and secondary measurements use RSRQ as the measurement quantity by\n\ndefault. Both primary and secondary measurements can use the same measurement quantity.\n\nMeasurement configuration information is sent to the UE in the\n\nRRCConnectionReconfiguration messages. A new version of the message is\n\nsent to the UE whenever the parameters are updated. This can occur when the UE completes a\n\nhandover to an LTE cell with different parameter settings.\n\nHaving two measurement thresholds for poor coverage evaluation allows the use of different\n\nhysteresis and timer values for the different threshold values.\n\nThe process for evaluation using the secondary parameters and threshold is similar, but\n\ndifferent parameter values can be used. For example, the\n\nReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.triggerQuantityA2Prim can be set to trigger\n\non RSRP measurements with a ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.hysteresisA2Prim\n\nvalue of 1 dB and the ReportConfigEUtraBadCovSec.triggerQuantityA2Sec can\n\nbe set to trigger on RSRQ measurements with a\n\nReportConfigEUtraBadCovSec.hysteresisA2Sec value of 2 dB.\n\nFigure 2   Poor Coverage Evaluation Process Using Primary Threshold\n\nThe UE uses parameters sent by the eNodeB to determine when to perform measurements.\n\nMeasurements begin on the neighboring cells when the RSRP of the serving cell falls below\n\nthe value defined in the UeMeasControl.sMeasure parameter. The parameter\n\nis also the trigger value for measurements used in intra-LTE handover.\n\nThe following describes the evaluation process for the primary trigger. The process for the\n\nsecondary trigger is identical and occurs in parallel with the primary process as\n\nfollows:\n\n1. The ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.triggerQuantityA2Prim parameter determines whether RSRP or RSRQ values trigger A2 measurement for the primary criterion. If the primary trigger quantity is set to RSRP, the threshold value set in ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.a2ThresholdRsrpPrim is sent to the UE. Otherwise, the RSRQ threshold value set in ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.a2ThresholdRsrqPrim is sent.\n2. The measured values of RSRP and RSRQ are filtered based on the settings of the UeMeasControl.filterCoefficientEUtraRsrp and UeMeasControl.filterCoefficientEUtraRsrq parameters. The filter averages a number of measurements to remove the impact of fast fading. The filter values are also used by the UE in the intra-LTE handover measurement process.\n3. The UE applies the hysteresis value of ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.hysteresisA2Prim to determine whether to trigger the A2 measurement.\n4. When A2 measurement is triggered, the UE waits the time predetermined in ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.timeToTriggerA2Prim before it begins sending measurement reports to the serving eNodeB. The reports contain measurements for the serving cell.\n5. Measurement reports are sent to the eNodeB periodically while the A2 measurement condition is fulfilled. The time interval between measurement reports is 480 ms.\n\nThe formula used by the UE for evaluating entry to A2 measurements is shown in the\n\nfollowing equation:\n\n| Ms                 |    | The measured value of the serving cell (either RSRP or RSRQ).                                                                                                                                            |\n|--------------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                    |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| a2ThresholdPrimary |    | The value of ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.a2ThresholdRsrpPrim or                 ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.a2ThresholdRsrqPrim depending on               whether the trigger quantity is RSRP or RSRQ. |\n\nThe UE uses the same hysteresis value to determine when to leave A2 measurement once the serving\n\ncell improves in RSRP or RSRQ relative to the neighboring cells. The formula used by the UE\n\nis shown in the following equation:\n\n| Ms                 |    | Measured value of the serving cell (either RSRP or RSRQ)                                                                                                                                                 |\n|--------------------|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                    |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| a2ThresholdPrimary |    | The value of ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.a2ThresholdRsrpPrim or                 ReportConfigEUtraBadCovPrim.a2ThresholdRsrqPrim depending on               whether the trigger quantity is RSRP or RSRQ. |\n\n# 4 Network Impact of Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity\n\nThe Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity feature provides mobility for UEs\n\nto CDMA-eHRPD networks if the LTE coverage becomes bad. This increases the available coverage\n\nfor UEs.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThis feature enhances network capacity by improving the possibility that the UE is\n\nserved by the best available frequency within the network.\n\nIt is possible to configure this feature in such a way that an off-loading effect is\n\nachieved, where UEs are transferred from the LTE frequency to another frequency.\n\nThis can be used to avoid overload and improve the overall network capacity.\n\nThe feature has no impact on the physical cell coverage, but offloading UEs to\n\nalternative frequencies indirectly means that the coverage is improved. Activating\n\nthe feature and setting the threshold for poor coverage puts limits on the range of\n\nUE in the LTE network.\n\nThis feature decreases the time needed for the UE to make connected mode transitions\n\nto another network.\n\nIf no session continuity features are activated, the UE loses LTE coverage completely\n\nbefore attempting to attach to another network.\n\nInterfaces\n\nThe feature introduces the SIB8 IE.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.\n\n# 5 Parameters for Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity\n\nThe Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity

Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute to DEACTIVATED in the FeatureState=CXC4010614 MO instance.\n\nAfter This Task\n\nKeep CCTR active for at least one week after this procedure for continued collection of troubleshooting data.\n\n# 9 Engineering Guidelines for Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity\n\nThe Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity feature needs to be configured\n\nfor optimal operation.\n\nConfigure Redirection of the UEs at Poor Coverage\n\nThe Coverage-Triggered CDMA-eHRPD Session Continuity feature requires no\n\ndirect connections between the LTE network and the CDMA-eHRPD network. To\n\nconfigure redirection of the UE at poor coverage, information about\n\nCDMA-eHRPD carrier frequencies must be entered in the eNodeB during\n\nnetwork configuration. The carrier frequency information is sent to the UE during\n\nthe redirection process to assist the UE in finding the CDMA-eHRPD\n\nfrequency. A Cdma2000FreqBandRelation and a corresponding\n\nCdma2000Freq MO must be created for each CDMA-eHRPD\n\nfrequency group where the UE needs to be redirected.\n\nFor each of the following frequency relation MO attributes a value corresponding to\n\nits priority relative to other frequency relations needs to be assigned:\n\n- Cdma2000FreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio\n- Cdma20001xRttFreqRelation.voicePrio\n- EUtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio\n- EUtranFreqRelation.voicePrio\n- UtranFreqRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio\n- UtranFreqRelation.voicePrio\n- GeranFreqGroupRelation.connectedModeMobilityPrio\n- GeranFreqGroupRelation.voicePrio\n\nThis is used when determining where to redirect the UE in case of poor coverage.\n\nMeasurement in the UE\n\nWhen a UE reports poor coverage, the eNodeB can directly transfer the UE to one of\n\nthe candidate frequencies or it can configure a new measurement in the UE to detect\n\npossible frequencies before the UE is transferred. If the\n\nUeMeasControl.ueMeasurementsActive parameter is set to\n\ntrue, a measurement is configured in the UE to help detect\n\nfrequencies where the UE can be transferred. If it is false, the UE\n\nis directly transferred to the new frequency without a new measurement.\n\nConfigure SIB8 Broadcast\n\nTo configure a cell to broadcast SIB8, which contains information and parameters\n\nrequired by the UE to perform idle mode reselection to the CDMA-eHRPD\n\nnetwork, Cdma2000FreqBandRelation MOs must be added as children\n\nof the EUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD. To make\n\nsure that SIB8 is broadcast, it must be mapped to an SI message. Map SIB8 to an SI\n\nmessage specified in Manage Radio Network and Manage Mobility.\n\n## 9.1 Restrictions of SIB8 Setting\n\nTo configure a cell to broadcast SIB8, which contains information and parameters required\n\nby the UE to perform idle mode reselection to the CDMA-eHRPD network,\n\nCdma2000FreqBandRelation MOs must be added as children of the\n\nEUtranCellFDD or EUtranCellTDD. To make sure\n\nthat SIB8 is broadcast, it must be mapped to an SI message. Map SIB8 to an SI message\n\nspecified in Manage Radio Network and Manage Mobility.\n\nThe session continuity of CDMA2000 systems requires the GPS-based CDMA system time for\n\nsingle Rx configuration UEs. The E-UTRA to CDMA2000 (HRPD or 1x) procedures are the\n\nfollowing:\n\n- Handover\n- Cell reselection\n- Measurement-based redirection\n- Enhanced CS Fallback to CDMA 1X\n\nThe CDMA system time is used mainly to inform the UE about the absolute time in the cell\n\nin order to synchronize to a CDMA2000 network, to derive the CDMA2000 physical cell\n\nidentity of neighboring cells, to perform measurements, and to communicate with the\n\nCDMA2000 network.\n\nThe CDMA system time information in SIB8 is synchronous or asynchronous. The CDMA system\n\ntime is distributed in order to facilitate accurate reporting of the pilot PN phases of\n\nthe target 1xRTT or HRPD cells, and to enable reliable handover to the 1xRTT or HRPD\n\nnetworks.",

The same principle is also\n\napplicable when NR SW is restarted for user with ESS configuration.\n\nNetwork Requirements\n\nNo special network requirements.\n\n# 3 Feature Operation of Software Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart\n\nThe feature introduces a new software upgrade method, for upgrades with no MOM changes,\n\nbased only on the delta software.\n\nSoftware Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart enables the new upgrade concept, to reduce\n\nand minimize the end user and the In-Service Performance impact when the software delta\n\nis limited to LTE, NR, and radio unit, and does not contain any MOM changes.\n\nThe Adaptive Restart is represented and controlled by the following attributes in the\n\nMOM:\n\n- UpgradePackage.UpgradeRestartType indicates whether an Upgrade Package (UP) is compatible with adaptive restart. The attribute is read-only and cannot be modified manually.\n- UpgradePackage.RestartType is an optional attribute, which can be set by the user at upgrade, to determine the restart logic as follows: If the COLD setting is selected, a system cold restart at upgrade is executed, regardless of the UP capability. If the ADAPTIVE setting is selected, the system checks the UP and selects the optimal restart based on UP delta. If no value is provided, the ADAPTIVE setting is used by default.\n\nFor LTE and NR, it means that only the LTE or NR software is upgraded and restarted, the\n\nrest of system is not affected. Similarly for the radio unit, only the radio unit\n\nsoftware is upgraded and restarted, without affecting the Baseband.\n\nThe Software Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart feature enhancement supports\n\nmultistandard configurations with LTE and GSM.\n\n# 4 Network Impact of Software Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart\n\nWith the feature, service downtime during upgrade is significantly\n\nreduced.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nImproved service availability because of the shorter downtime during upgrade.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.\n\n# 5 Parameters of Software Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart\n\nThe feature has no configuration parameters.\n\n# 6 Performance of Software Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart\n\nWhen Software Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart is applied, the service downtime\n\nis reduced.\n\nKPIs\n\nThis feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators\n\nCounters\n\nThis feature has no directly associated counters.\n\nEvents\n\nThis feature has no associated events.\n\n# 7 Activate Software Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart\n\nSoftware Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart is a basic feature. It does not require\n\nmanual activation.\n\n# 8 Deactivate Software Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart\n\nSoftware Upgrade with System Adaptive Restart is a basic feature. It can be disabled\n\nif necessary.\n\nDo the following to disable the feature:\n\nSteps\n\n1. During SW upgrade procedure continue with COLD flag in MO UP activate action.

In such cases, identified fingerprints and entitlements must be cleaned up before migration to Instantaneous Licensing.\n- The fingerprints include licenses which are wrongly activated or include licenses which are not compliant with LCS and HCS definitions as follows: Wrong price model for HWACs Multiple or wrong payment models Inconsistent base package or value package sets Overactivation of HWACs or capacity license objects Old licenses or HWACs, for example, DU licenses Restricted features It is recommended to perform ELIS clean-up for all identified nodes.\n\nRadio Node Configuration Types\n\nAnalyze the radio node configuration types in the network and how they might benefit\n\nfrom Instantaneous Licensing by doing the following:\n\n- Compare the radio node types with the Instantaneous Licensing support that is offered for different RATs in the given RAN software release.\n- Study the supported radio node configurations and limitations in the given RAN software release.\n\n## 2.3 Operational Impact Analysis\n\nThe goal of this task is to analyze the operational impact of Instantaneous Licensing. It\n\nis recommended to document all findings of this analysis in an Operation Solution\n\nDeployment Analysis report.\n\nThe Customer Unit and the operator are responsible for this task.\n\nImpact on Operation\n\nAnalyze how operation is affected for the following cases:\n\n- Additional radio node hardware or software configurations are introduced and updates of the License Configuration Sets (LCSs) and HWAC Configuration Sets (HCSs) are required.\n- Radio nodes are introduced, replaced, migrated, moved, upgraded, or reconfigured and handling of related licenses is affected.\n- Communication about changes required in the network to support Instantaneous Licensing interactions.\n- Communication about changes of LCSs and HCSs between operator and Ericsson.\n- Support procedures for alarms or errors Note: In some scenarios, such as emergency unlock, return of licenses, and for unsupported products or standards, a manual request of license keys is required.\n\nImpact on Responsible Roles in the Organization\n\nAnalyze and identify responsible roles in the organization for the following\n\nareas:\n\n- Software Asset Manager, IL Manager, and SSP-LKM\n- License Key Request generation using ENM Flow Automation\n- Support procedures\n\n## 2.4 Create Solution Deployment Plan\n\nThe goal of this task is to create a deployment plan for Instantaneous\n\nLicensing.\n\nThe Customer Unit and the operator are responsible for this task.\n\nThe non-connected mode Instantaneous Licensing deployment plan is created based on the\n\nfindings in the Technical Impact Analysis and the\n\nOperational Impact Analysis. The deployment\n\nplan includes the following:\n\n- Tasks to be performed and timing.\n- Resources required to secure the necessary operational and technical preparation.\n- Phasing and timing for deployment, including lab trials, limited field trials, and full deployment.\n\n# 3 Non-Connected Mode Instantaneous Licensing Solution Design\n\nThe required HWAC Configuration Sets (HCSs) and License Configuration Sets (LCSs) are\n\ncreated and network configurations are prepared.\n\nThe goal of this task is to design a commercial strategy for the Instantaneous Licensing\n\nsolution in the radio network.\n\nThe Customer Unit is responsible for this task.\n\n## 3.1 Create HCSs and LCSs for the Radio Network\n\nThe goal of this task is to create the required License Configuration Sets (LCSs) and\n\nHardware Configuration Sets (HCSs) for the nodes in the radio network based on the\n\nTechnical Solution Impact Analysis created in Technical Impact Analysis.\n\nThe Customer Unit is responsible for this task.\n\n### 3.1.1 Define HWAC Configuration Sets\n\nAll HWAC configurations for an EUFT can be managed within one Baseband-HCS, but it might\n\nlead to an overconsumption of entitlements. It is recommended that the configuration of\n\nHCSs is balanced between having fewer HCSs, and minimizing overconsumption.\n\nConfiguration also depends on the type of commercial agreement in place. The following\n\naspects must be considered:\n\n- Product types used in the network, for example Baseband 5216 and Baseband 6630\n- Mix of RATs on a product, for example Baseband 6630 LTE, Baseband 6630 NR, and nodes with both LTE and NR.\n- Separate pricing model or different default capacity on a product. For example, Baseband 6630 LTE ABW and Baseband 6630 LTE ABW + Massive MIMO might require a separate HCS.Note: Mixed ABW and Massive MIMO pricing models can coexist.\n\n### 3.1.2 Define HWAC Configuration Set Details\n\nBased on the HWAC Configuration Set (HCS), the common and variable parts for each HCS\n\nmust be defined as follows:\n\n| Common part   |    | Defines the set of HWACs that is activated on a given Baseband unit and                             given RAT. The common part can contain several HWACs of any                             capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|---------------|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|               |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Variable part |    | Defines which HUP size is activated on the request of the node. The                             variable part specifies which HUP is used to fill the gap between the                             level that is activated from the initial package and the common part of                             Baseband HCS, and the level that the node requests. Multiple HUPs can be                             specified for a given Baseband type and given RAT. This results in a HUP                             set with the lowest overall cost. This configuration is recommended, as                             it allows network management through a single HCS. |\n\n### 3.1.3 Define License Configuration Sets\n\nBased on the node configuration in the radio network, the required License Configuration\n\nSets (LCSs) must be defined as follows:\n\n- The goal is to define a single LCS to manage all nodes in the network. The use of multiple LCSs might cause problems if the wrong LCS is selected during node integration or migration to Instantaneous Licensing. In addition, migration between several LCSs is not a fully automated procedure and manual handling is required for license return.\n- Fewer LCSs are required in the following cases: Different Baseband HCSs are defined A fixed quantity is set for licenses or HWACs Various fixed values are required because of node configuration\n\n### 3.1.4 Define Special Activation Rules\n\nDetermine if special activation rules are required based on the node configuration in the\n\nradio network. The following aspects must be considered:\n\n- It is recommended to avoid the use of special activation rules to maintain simplicity within the deployment.\n- If required by contract, it is possible to activate selected HWACs with a defined quantity based on the RAN Compute Unit connected to the radio node. This setting is applicable for all nodes managed by Instantaneous Licensing.\n- If necessary within the Instantaneous Licensing solution, new special activation rules must be requested manually. Operators might request rules, such as the activation of licenses and HWACs in advance to avoid licensing issues during expansion.\n\nIt is recommended to document all defined LCSs and HCSs in a Licensing\n\nConfiguration Definition report, which can later be shared with the\n\noperator.\n\n# 4 Order Non-Connected Mode Instantaneous Licensing Solution\n\nThe goal of this task is to order the required access rights and configure the required\n\ndata for Instantaneous Licensing migration.\n\n## 4.1 Order SAM Access\n\nThe goal of this task is to order access to Software Asset Management (SAM), which is\n\nused to configure Instantaneous Licensing.\n\nThe Customer Unit and the operator are responsible for this task.\n\nThe order procedure consists of the following steps:\n\n- The Customer Unit orders the access rights to SAM using an Ericsson internal tool.\n- The operator is onboarded through a standard process, using the identity life cycle management application ISIGNUM. ISIGNUM is available through Extranet support.\n\nThe Customer Unit can apply for access rights that allow the following:\n\n- Configuring Instantaneous Licensing\n- Migrating hardware to Instantaneous Licensing\n- Reading the configuration of IL Manager\n\nOperators can apply for access rights to read configurations in IL Manager, which is part\n\nof SAM.\n\n## 4.2 ELIS Preparation\n\nThe goal of this task is to prepare the data in Ericsson License System (ELIS) for\n\nthe deployment of the Instantaneous Licensing solution.\n\nThe Customer Unit is responsible for this task.\n\nBased on the Technical Solution Impact Analysis, the Customer Unit performs\n\nthe following tasks:\n\n1. Manually orders LKFs at the license key expiration date if the Term-Based Licensing (TBL) payment model is chosen. The Instantaneous Licensing solution does not update the end dates of license keys and a manual request is required to extend them.\n2. Ensures that the entitlements stock in Ericsson Electronic Licensing Solution (ELIS) reflects the License Configuration Sets (LCSs) and HWAC Configuration Sets (HCSs) definitions defined in the Licensing Configuration Definition report. If there is a shortage, additional items must be ordered.\n3. Returns fingerprints with entitlements activated in more than one EUFT group if the radio nodes are manually connected to a single operator EUFT.\n4. For all identified fingerprints that have wrongly activated licenses or have licenses not compliant with LCS and HCS definitions, clean-up in ELIS must be done. Instantaneous Licensing supports an optional method to sort out such problems automatically by performing LKF clean-up at migration to Instantaneous Licensing.\n\n# 5 Migrate to Non-Connected Mode Instantaneous Licensing\n\nThe necessary applications and ENM flows are prepared and the migration is executed.\n\n## 5.1 Initialize SAM\n\nThe goal of this task is to configure Software Asset Management (SAM) for\n\nInstantaneous Licensing.\n\nThe Customer Unit is responsible for this task.\n\nThe configuration procedure consists of the following steps:\n\n1. Configuring the operator EUFT and the receiver of SAM and Instantaneous Licensing notifications using the Technical Solution Impact Analysis report created in Technical Impact Analysis and the Operation Solution Deployment Analysis report created in Operational Impact Analysis.\n2. Creating or modifying required HWAC Configuration Set (HCSs) in IL Manager using the Licensing Configuration Definition report created in Define Special Activation Rules.\n3. Creating or modifying required License Configuration Sets (LCSs) in IL Manager using the Licensing Configuration Definition report created in Define Special Activation Rules.\n4. Updating the Licensing Configuration Definition document with the LCS IDs by creating or deleting activation rules in IL Manager. Note: The pre-sales support engineer is responsible for the coherence of the defined rules.\n5. Updating the Licensing Configuration Definition document with the LCS IDs. Note: This document is shared with the operator for support procedures.\n\n## 5.2 Import Flow Automation Package Using ENM\n\nThe goal of this task is to download the software package containing the flow and\n\nimport it into ENM Flow Automation.\n\nThe operator is responsible for this task.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Download the flow package ZIP from the Ericsson Software Gateway. Note: The flow package ZIP file contains another ZIP file that is used for the actual installation.\n2. Extract the flow package ZIP file to a directory which ENM has access to.\n3. Log on to ENM.\n4. Start Flow Automation in ENM.\n5. Go to View Flow Catalog and click Import Flow.\n6. Select the previously extracted ZIP file.\n7. When the installation is completed, the flow is ready to be used. For information on how to generate an LRF, see Generate Radio Node License Request File in Flow Catalog by clicking View Flow Catalog in ENM Flow Automation.\n\n## 5.3 Migrate Baseband Radio Node with Selected Licensing Strategy\n\nAfter the migration process is completed, the final steps ensure that Instantaneous\n\nLicensing operates according to project specifications.\n\nThe goal of this task is to migrate existing radio nodes in a radio network to the\n\nInstantaneous Licensing solution and to allocate them to a specific licensing\n\nstrategy.\n\nThe Customer Unit and the operator are responsible for this task.\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n- Migration in IL Manager\n- Migration with ELIS clean-up\n- Migration to another LCS\n\n### 5.3.1 Migration in IL Manager\n\nSteps\n\nThe following steps are performed by the Customer Unit:\n\n1. Create a list of fingerprints and License Configuration Set (LCS) IDs for the radio nodes that are intended to be controlled by Instantaneous Licensing. The list is created together with the operator.\n2. Migrate one or multiple hardware resources from the list to Instantaneous Licensing using one of the following methods: A hardware resource is migrated individually from HW Resource to IL in IL Manager, by using the Single Migration option. Multiple hardware resources are migrated in batch from HW Resource to IL in IL Manager, by using the Batch Migration option. A Migration File Template can be downloaded and used for batch migrations.\n3. Verify the status of the hardware resources by using the Request Status option. Note: A status report can be downloaded as an Excel sheet.\n4. Confirm Software Asset Management (SAM) and Instantaneous Licensing readiness.\n5. Locate LKF files by searching for the fingerprints in SSP-LKF Portal &gt; Search Key &amp; FS. For Single Migration: use Search criteria &gt; Detailed search. For Batch Migration: use Search criteria &gt; File based. As for input, the same Migration File Template can be used.\n\nThe following steps are performed by the operator:\n\n6. Import the LKF to ENM SHM and install it on selected network elements. For detailed instructions, see section Manage License Key Files in Software Hardware Manager.\n7. Set the connection mode on target radio nodes to OFFLINE\\_MODE.\n\n### 5.3.2 Migration with ELIS Clean-Up\n\nThe goal of this task is to perform automated LKF clean-up activity at migration to\n\nInstantaneous Licensing.\n\nThe Customer Unit and the operator are responsible for this task.\n\nSteps\n\nThe following steps are performed by the Customer Unit:\n\n1. Create a list of fingerprints and License Configuration Set (LCS) IDs for the radio nodes that are intended to be controlled by the Instantaneous Licensing feature. The list is created together with the operator.\n2. Migrate one or multiple hardware resources from the list to Instantaneous Licensing using one of the following methods: A hardware resource is migrated individually from HW Resource to IL in IL Manager, by using the Single Migration option. Multiple hardware resources are migrated in batch from HW Resource to IL in IL Manager, by using the Batch Migration option. A Migration File Template can be downloaded and used for batch migrations.\n3. Verify the status of the hardware resources by using the Request Status option. Note: A status report can be downloaded as an Excel sheet.\n4. Confirm Software Asset Management (SAM) and Instantaneous Licensing readiness\n5. Configure the LKF clean-up exemption in IL Manager by providing a list of fingerprints which are to be cleaned up. If all fingerprints in the network require clean-up, the exemption must be set at the EUFT level.\n\nThe following steps are performed by the operator:\n\n6. Generate an LRF with License Demand Content set to FULL\\_DEMAND, submit it to SSP-LKM and download the LKF.\n7. Import the LKF to ENM SHM and install it on selected network elements. For detailed instructions, see the section Manage License Key Files in Software Hardware Manager.\n8. Set the connection mode on target radio nodes to OFFLINE\\_MODE.\n\n### 5.3.3 Migration to Another LCS\n\nThis task involves activities, some of which are performed on the radio node by\n\nCustomer Engineer and some are performed in IL Manager by the Customer Unit. These\n\nsteps need to be coordinated throughout the following flow.\n\nSteps\n\nThe following steps are performed by the Customer Unit:\n\n1. Disconnect the radio node from the LCS by using the HW Resources to LCS section in the IL Manager. For more information, see IL Manager User Guide.\n2. Submit an ELAS support ticket for a manual clean-up in ELIS if required. Wait until a new LKF is generated.\n3. Connect the radio node to the LCS by using the HW Resources to LCS section in the IL Manager.\n\nThe following step is performed by Customer Engineer:\n\n4. Optional: Set the ENodeBFunction.dlBbCapacityTarget and the GNBDUFunction.dlBbCapacityTarget attributes if a radio node is migrated to LCS with the throughput price model.\n\nThe following step is performed by the Customer Unit:\n\n5. Perform LKF regenerate for selected fingerprints and specify LKF Receivers in SSP-LKM.\n\nThe following step is performed by Customer Engineer:\n\n6. Download the LKF Package and install LKFs on radio nodes. Note: This procedure is valid for migrating a node to another LCS by using the same price model in LCSs. Step 1 cannot be performed when only the Integration LKF is created. An ELAS ticket for manual support must be created to return license resources and disable a node in ELIS. When this is completed, an Integration LKF can be recreated.\n\n# 6 Non-Connected Mode Instantaneous Licensing Migration Troubleshooting\n\nThis troubleshooting section provides guidance in case errors or alarms occur and\n\nmigration cannot be completed.\n\n## 6.1 ENM\n\nFingerprint Uniqueness\n\nENM cannot ensure fingerprint uniqueness in all cases. The operator is responsible\n\nfor fingerprint uniqueness. If duplicate fingerprints exist in the network, LKF\n\ngeneration in Electronic License Information System (ELIS) might fail.\n\n## 6.2 Baseband Radio Node\n\nSynchronization between ENM and the Radio Node\n\nCheck the synchronization status in the ENM Command Line\n\nInterface by using command: cmedit get &lt;node name&gt; --\n\nsyncstatus\n\nExample:\n\n```\n>>cmedit get SELIITRBS01293 -- syncstatus\nFDN : Subnetwork=NS_Cluster, MeContext= SELIITRBS01293 syncStatus : \nSYNCHRONIZED\n```\n\nIf the node is not synchronized, troubleshoot the connection according to the\n\ninstructions in ENM Configuration Troubleshooting Guide.\n\n## 6.3 Flow Automation\n\nWhen a License Request File (LRF) Activation flow is executed in ENM Flow Automation, the\n\nexecution section in the report page shows a summary, and error descriptions if a radio\n\nnode fails to generate an LRF.\n\nWhen problems found in the error description are resolved, the ENM flow must be executed\n\nagain for the affected nodes.\n\n## 6.4 SSP-LKM\n\nWhen transactions in SSP-LKM are completed, a report with information about encountered\n\nerrors can be downloaded.\n\nThe SSP-LKM User Guide provides instruction on how to handle errors.\n\nExternal users are provided with list of errors with instruction how to resolve them.\n\nFor errors that the user cannot resolve, contact the next level of Ericsson support.\n\nWhen the error is resolved, the LRF must be resubmitted to SSP-LKM.",

HWAC keys are required\n\nto enable or activate hardware-related capabilities as follows:\n\n- Hardware-related features must be activated after the LKF is installed on the node. Features can be deactivated at any time.\n- Hardware-related capacities are enabled automatically, when the LKF is installed.\n\nThe LKF contains license keys and HWAC keys that are requested for a specific node. This\n\nmeans that each LKF is unique to the node, and each node can have only one valid LKF.\n\nEach key entry in the LKF contains the following information:\n\n- The ID of the key (for example, CXC4011022).\n- The name of the feature or capacity.\n- The value of the capacity.\n- The associated validity period.\n\nAn LKF can be requested either manually or using Instantaneous Licensing. For information\n\non the Instantaneous Licensing solution, see Instantaneous Licensing. For information on\n\nthe Instantaneous Licensing use cases and procedures, see Manage Licenses and Hardware Activation\n\nCodes.\n\n## 1.1 Install License Key File on Baseband Products\n\nPrerequisites\n\n- The LKF is available for installation. The path to the LKF is defined in the RBS Summary File, as described in Manage Configuration Files.\n- The date and time settings of the system clock in the node are correct. If the settings are incorrect, the LKF can be rejected by the node during installation.\n- The fingerprint of the node is configured. The fingerprint is permanent, and it cannot be changed after the first successful installation of the LKF. The fingerprint in the LKF must match the fingerprint of the node. If the fingerprints do not match, the LKF is rejected.\n- No other LKF installations are ongoing on the node.\n- If the LKF is stored on an SFTP server, the password is required to access the server.\n- The fail-safe backup function is activated. Some licenses or HWACs can cause O&amp;M connectivity failure, if their respective license key or HWAC key is missing from the LKF. If the fail-safe backup function is activated, the system can recover from the failure. The system performs the automatic restore from a backup, if the configuration is not confirmed within the predefined rollback period. For more information, see Manage Software.\n- When the node runs in power saving mode,the capacity supported by the power saving mode can be exceeded if more HWAC capacity is required. For more information on Baseband Power Savings, see Manage Hardware Equipment.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Run the installKeyFile (&lt;uri&gt;, &lt;password&gt;) action in the KeyFileManagement MO to start the installation. The URI specifies the location where the LKF is stored. The password parameter is required to access the location specified in the URI. The password parameter must always be provided, even if it is not a requirement to provide a password for the specified location. The progress of the installation can be monitored through the KeyFileManagement.reportProgress attribute.\n2. Check the result in the KeyFileManagement.reportProgress attribute.\n\nIf the parameter is FAILURE, do the following:\n\n3. Read and evaluate the resultInfo field of the KeyFileManagement.reportProgress attribute.\n\nIf the parameter is SUCCESS, do the following:\n\n4. If needed, check that the correct LKF is installed by reading the KeyFileInformation.sequenceNumber MO.\n\nResults\n\nThe Lm MO updates its MO structure to reflect the new LKF\n\ninformation. For each entry in the LKF, the following changes are implemented:\n\n- For every optional feature, FeatureState and FeatureKey are created. FeatureState.keyId and FeatureKey.keyId receive the value of the featureKey id from the LKF.\n- For every capacity, CapacityState and CapacityKey are created. CapacityState.keyId and CapacityKey.keyId receive the value of the capacityKey id from the LKF.\n\nThe FeatureState.licenseState and\n\nCapacityState.licenseState attribute becomes\n\nENABLED for each license key or HWAC key in the installed\n\nLKF.\n\nAfter This Task\n\nDeactivate the fail-safe backup function.\n\n## 1.2 Install License Key File on DU Products\n\nSteps\n\n1. Run the updateLicenseKeyFile (&lt;userId&gt;, &lt;password&gt;, &lt;ipAddress&gt;, &lt;sfile&gt;) action in the Licensing MO. The parameters in the updateLicenseKeyFile action are the following: userId The login ID to the FTP or SFTP server where the LKF is located. password The password of the server. ipAddress The domain name, IPv4 or IPv6 address of the server. sFile Source name and path of the LKF on the server.\n2. Check the result on the Licensing.lastLicensingPiChange attribute to verify that the LKF is installed successfully. Note: If the installation is not successful, check the active alarms.\n\n# 2 Hardware-Related Features\n\nHardware-related features enhance the functionality of hardware units in a\n\nnode.\n\nEnabling a hardware-related feature requires a valid HWAC key in the LKF which is\n\ninstalled on the node.\n\nIn the LKF, each HWAC key entry contains the following information about the\n\nfeatures:\n\n- The featureKey id element is the identification of the HWAC key for the feature. This is a unique code for each feature.\n- The description element contains the name of the feature.\n- The start and stop elements indicate the beginning and the end of the validity period.\n\nAfter the LKF is installed, the feature must be activated.\n\n## 2.1 Activate Feature\n\nOptional features and basic features with license or HWAC keys must be activated.\n\nCapacities are activated automatically when the LKF is installed.\n\nPrerequisites\n\n- The fail-safe backup function is activated. Some licenses or HWACs can cause O&amp;M connectivity failure, if their respective license key or HWAC key is missing from the LKF. If the fail-safe backup function is activated, the system can recover from the failure. The system performs the automatic restore from a backup, if the configuration is not confirmed within the predefined rollback period. For more information, see Manage Software.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Ensure that the corresponding license key is installed by checking that the FeatureState.licenseState attribute for the feature is ENABLED.\n2. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute MO for the respective feature to ACTIVATED.\n\nAfter This Task\n\nDeactivate the fail-safe backup function.\n\n## 2.2 Deactivate Feature\n\nOptional features and basic features with license or HWAC keys can be deactivated.\n\nCapacities do not need to be deactivated. If the license or HWAC key becomes invalid, or\n\nexpires, they are disabled automatically.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe fail-safe backup function is activated.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Set the FeatureState.featureState attribute for the respective feature to DEACTIVATED.\n\nAfter This Task\n\nDeactivate the fail-safe backup function.\n\n## 2.3 List of Hardware-Related Features\n\nTable 1   Hardware-Related Features\n\n| Feature Name                                                                                                   | Feature Key   | Product Number   | Valid for                                       | Valid for               |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Feature Name                                                                                                   | Feature Key   | Product Number   | Hardware Unit                                   | Radio Access Technology |\n| LTE IP Optical Interface                                                                                       | CXC 401 0324  | FAK 101 0007     | Baseband                                        | LTE                     |\n| Radio Processor 6507 (Physical HW)                                                                             | CXC 401 2472  | FAK 101 0239     | Radio Processor 6507                            | NR, LTE                 |\n| HWAC 2T2R Micro Radio (Max 10W per Branch) Connection to Radio                                 Processor 6507  | CXC 401 2623  | FAK 101 0240     | Radio Processor 6507                            | NR, LTE                 |\n| HWAC 4T4R Micro Radio (Max 5W per Branch) Connection to Radio                                 Processor 6507   | CXC 401 2624  | FAK 101 0241     | Radio Processor 6507                            | NR, LTE                 |\n| HWAC 4T4R Street Radio (Max 20W per Branch) Connection to Radio                                 Processor 6507 | CXC 401 2625  | FAK 101 0242     | Radio Processor 6507                            | NR, LTE                 |\n| HWAC IRU 4T4R Connection to Radio Processor 6507                                                               | CXC 401 2627  | FAK 101 0244     | Radio Processor 6507                            | NR, LTE                 |\n| HWAC IRU 8T8R Connection to Radio Processor 6507                                                               | CXC 401 2628  | FAK 101 0245     | Radio Processor 6507                            | NR, LTE                 |\n| PIM Cancellation in Radio                                                                                      | CXC 401 2387  | FAK 101 0161     | Supported Hardware of PIM Cancellation in Radio | NR, LTE                 |\n\n# 3 Hardware-Related Capacities\n\nHardware-related capacities provide additional hardware resources in a\n\nnode.\n\nEnabling a hardware-related capacity requires a valid HWAC key in the LKF which is\n\ninstalled on the node.\n\nIn the LKF, each HWAC key entry contains the following information about the\n\ncapacities:\n\n- The capacityKey id element is the identification of the HWAC key for the capacity.

When the power level is\n\nseamlessly increased or decreased, interruption times can occur.\n\nThe main reasons for radio output power limitations are the following:\n\n- High temperature and hardware protection\n- Not exceeding regulatory requirements\n- Radio unit filter attenuation at band edge\n- Insufficient input power to radio units\n\nWhen insufficient input power to radio units is detected, the RF output power is\n\ngracefully backed-off. During graceful back-off, the node maintains the coverage for the\n\naffected cell or cells by decreasing the maximum traffic and performing a power\n\nboost.\n\n## 3.3 List of Baseband Utility Modules and Utilization Packages\n\nUtility modules enable the basic or extended hardware functionality of Baseband\n\nunits.\n\nEach Baseband unit requires exactly one initial module to function. The installation\n\nof multiple initial modules is not supported. The type of the initial module\n\ndetermines the type of capacity enabled on the Baseband unit.

required level. By default, aggregated EIRP of\n\n47 dBm is available for each radio for one or more carriers.\n\nEIRP is the strongest equivalent output power of the carrier that is used by an\n\nMassive MIMO radio unit. It is available in the direction with maximum antenna gain.\n\nIf the radio has more than one carrier, aggregated EIRP is used to calculate the\n\nHWAC for the Massive MIMO radio units. The configurable EIRP values of the carriers,\n\nand therefore the maximal useful number of HWAC steps, depend on the following\n\nfactors:\n\n- Massive MIMO radio unit in use\n- Frequency band in use\n- Configuration mode in use\n\nFor more information, see the description of the specific radio unit.\n\n## 4.1 Calculate NR mmWave EIRP 1 dB Step Output Power HWAC\n\nThe aggregated EIRP HWAC individual Massive MIMO radio units require is recommended\n\nto be calculated with at least one decimal.

Once\n\nHWAC license is required for each radio and each node to activate PIM Cancellation in\n\nRadio.\n\nPIM Cancellation in Radio protects uplink signals by suppressing third- and fifth-order\n\nin-line PIM that is generated by downlink signals. Receiver sensitivity is affected if\n\nPIM overlaps receiver signals in the spectrum. With PIM Cancellation in Radio, the\n\noverlapping PIM is suppressed, which improves receiver sensitivity. PIM sources are\n\nconsidered stable or non-linear. The characteristics of stable PIM sources vary because\n\nof temperature and aging. Non-linear PIM sources have the following characteristics:\n\n- No saturation of third-order and fifth-order intermodulation products\n- Third-order intermodulation is stronger than fifth-order\n\nPIM Cancellation in Radio provides the following benefits:\n\n- Fewer site visits for PIM source cleaning\n- Improved cell capacity\n- Improved cell coverage\n- Improved uplink KPIs for NR and LTE FDD radios\n- Improved uplink throughput\n- Mitigation of the receiver sensitivity degradation caused by PIM\n\nFor Multistandard Mixed Mode (MSMM) radio, the PIM Cancellation in Radio\n\nHWAC license is allocated for each node and for each radio. It means that if a radio\n\nunit is shared by two nodes, one HWAC license on each node is required to enable PIM\n\nCancellation in Radio on the specific node. In total, it requires two HWAC licenses to\n\nenable PIM Cancellation in Radio on all carriers on both nodes If multiple nodes are\n\nconnected to the same radio unit, each node has uplink victim cells that need a HWAC\n\nlicense. The nodes only have aggressor cells that do not require a license to support\n\nthe PIM Cancellation in Radio.\n\nRelated concepts\n\nPerformance of PIM Cancellation in Radio\n\nPIM Cancellation in Radio Related Alarms\n\nSupported Hardware of PIM Cancellation in Radio\n\nRelated tasks\n\nConfigure PIM Cancellation in Radio\n\n## 5.1 Configure PIM Cancellation in Radio\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe radio unit must be locked before the PIM Cancellation in Radio configuration is\n\nchanged.\n\nSteps\n\n1.

PIM Cancellation in Radio configuration requires one HWAC license for each radio and each node.\n- The MO Configuration Not Consistent With Installed Equipment alarm indicates that the radio is not supported for PIM Cancellation in Radio.\n- The HW Partial Fault alarm indicates a hardware fault in internal connectivity that disables PIM cancellation.

This allows a single Baseband CPRI link to connect to up to 16 radio units by multiplexing each radio through a Baseband R503 unit. For details about Baseband R503 unit capacities, see Baseband Description.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nFor more information on internal radio, see Radio Unit Description and\n\nIndoor Radio Unit Description.\n\nFor more information on external radio, see Radio Description,\n\nRemote Radio Unit Description and Antenna Integrated Radio\n\nUnit Description of the specific radio units, and Indoor Radio Unit\n\nDescription.\n\n# 2 Dependencies of Cascadable Radio Units\n\nThis section contains information on prerequisite features for the Cascadable Radio\n\nUnits feature.\n\nTable 1   Feature Dependencies\n\n| Feature                                                                                      | Relationship   | Description                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dual-Antenna Downlink Performance                                     Package (FAJ 121 0486) | Prerequisite   | A combined cell requires a Dual-Antenna Downlink Performance                                     Package license              |\n| 6 Cell Support (FAJ 121 1821)                                                                | Prerequisite   | A cascade configuration with six sectors for each node requires a                                     6 Cell Support license. |\n\nHardware\n\nThe following must be fulfilled for the feature to be operational:\n\n- The radio units connected in the cascade chain must be configured. Radio Node Configurations provides information about supported radio units.\n- The following additional limitations apply: Per standard Radio unit Baseband\n\nInternal radios and external radios cannot be used in the same cascade chain. IRUs\n\ncan be cascaded with either external or internal radios. Each connection between the\n\nunits in a cascade chain must be of the same CPRI line rate or of lower rate than\n\nthe connection immediately previous in the cascade chain.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe following limitation apply when cascading with Baseband R503:\n\n- For LTE Baseband units, the maximum number of radio units per cascade chain is five.\n\nBoth symmetrical and asymmetrical configurations are supported.\n\nFor more details on cascading, and radio configurations with Baseband R503, see Radio Node Configurations.\n\nNetwork Requirements\n\nNo Network Requirements for this feature.\n\n# 3 Feature Operation of Cascadable Radio Units\n\nEach radio unit has two CPRI ports, named DATA\\_1 and DATA\\_2. By using both of the\n\nports, it is possible to connect the radio units in a cascade. A total of 16 radio units can be\n\nconnected with a Baseband R503 splitter block in a cascade chain. In case of Baseband R,\n\nRadio Gateway R608 units and the LC-05 9xCPRI line card,\n\nthere can be a maximum of five radios in a cascade chain.\n\nRiPort Connections\n\nAn example of RiPort connection of a cascade configuration is shown in Figure 1. In this example, the cable (electrical for the\n\ninternal radio, and optical for the external radio) is connected to one of Baseband unit\n\nRiPorts. The cable from the Baseband unit is connected to DATA\\_1 of Internal Radio 1. The\n\nDATA\\_2 RiPort of Internal Radio 1 is connected to the DATA\\_1 RiPort of Internal Radio 2.\n\nAdditional Baseband R503 units can also be connected to the Baseband Unit RiPorts, which\n\nenables more radios to be connected to the Baseband Unit. While connecting radios to RiPort,\n\nthe direction of the ports must be 1 to 2 or 2 to 1 consistently within the whole cascade\n\nchain. For additional limitations, see Radio Node Configurations. For the external radio, optical\n\nconnection can be used. If using the conversion function, for example conversion from eCPRI\n\nto CPRI, the Radio Gateway R608 or the LC-05 9xCPRI line card can be used by connecting the\n\nBaseband unit and Radio Gateway unit with an eCPRI link, and connecting the Radio unit and\n\nRadio Gateway unit with a CPRI link. Between the Mixed Mode Baseband unit and the Radio\n\nGateway R608 unit, or the Baseband unit and the LC-05 9xCPRI line card, considering\n\ncapacity, a maximum of four eCPRI links are supported. The following units support both\n\nelectrical and optical cables:\n\n- Baseband R503\n- Radio Gateway R608\n- LC-05 9xCPRI line card\n\nFigure 1   An Example of RiPort Connections of a Cascade Configuration\n\nFigure 2   Example of RiPort Connections of a Cascade Configuration with Baseband R503\n\nFigure 3   Example of RiPort Connections of a Cascade Configuration with Radio Gateway\n\nR608\n\nFigure 4   Example of RiPort Connections of a Cascade Configuration with LC-05 9xCPRI Line\n\nCard\n\nFor Radio 6626 and Radio 4466, four CPRI ports can be used and are applicable to FDD only.\n\nIn the radio cascade configuration, DATA\\_1 and DATA\\_3 can only be used as cascade-in port,\n\nwhile DATA\\_2 and DATA\\_4 can only be used as cascade-out port for connections to the next\n\ncascaded radio. Both cascade chains on the same radio unit can be used only if they are\n\nconnected to different Baseband Radio Nodes.\n\nFigure 5   Example of Cascade Configuration with Two Baseband Radio Nodes Sharing the Same Radio\n\nUnit\n\nRelated concepts\n\nEngineering Guidelines for Cascadable Radio Configurations\n\n# 4 Network Impact of Cascadable Radio Units\n\nThis section describes how the Cascadable Radio Units feature impacts the network\n\nfunctions and\n\ncapabilities.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThe feature increases the number of supported radios for each Baseband Unit.\n\nDue to the internal delay between the two RiPorts of a radio, the maximum fiber\n\ndistance of a cascaded configuration between the Baseband unit and the last radio in\n\nthe chain is less than what can be supported without cascading. The reduced fiber\n\ndistance is a function of the number of radios in the chain.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.\n\n# 5 Parameters of Cascadable Radio Units\n\nThe implementation of this feature does not introduce any new parameters and affects no\n\nparameters.\n\n# 6 Performance of Cascadable Radio Units\n\nThis section describes performance indicators, counters, and events associated with\n\nthe Cascadable Radio Units feature.\n\nKPIs\n\nThis feature has no associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).\n\nCounters\n\nThis feature has no directly associated counters.\n\nEvents\n\nThis feature has no associated events.\n\n# 7 Activate Non-License-Controlled Features\n\nNon-license-controlled features do not require manual activation and cannot be\n\ndeactivated.\n\nWhile license-controlled features need to be activated, non-license-controlled features\n\nare activated automatically during node integration. They also do not\n\nhave\n\na software license key associated, which means that they have no\n\nentries in the LKF that is installed on the node.\n\nIn some cases, non-license-controlled features need to be configured\n\nmanually or have some of\n\ntheir\n\nsubfunctions enabled to work properly.\n\n# 8 Engineering Guidelines for Cascadable Radio Configurations\n\nThe following are examples of Cascadable Radio Unit configurations. Radio Node Configurations shows which radio types can be mixed in cascade chains.\n\n- Six sectors, 2x2 MIMO for each sector, 2 radios for each chain, see Figure 6 Figure 6 Six Sectors, 2x2 MIMO, Two External Radios for Each Chain\n- Six sectors, 2x2 MIMO for each sector, 2 radios for each chain, see Figure 7 Figure 7 Six Sectors, 2x2 MIMO, Two Internal Radios for Each Chain\n- Three sectors, four-way Receive (RX) diversity, remote radios and RRUS A2 for each chain, see Figure 8 Figure 8 Three Sectors, Four-Way RX Diversity, External Radio and RRUS A2\n- Three sectors, 2x2 MIMO for each sector, three external radios for each chain, see Figure 9 Figure 9 Three Sectors, 2x2 MIMO, Three External Radios for Each Chain\n\nIt is possible to\n\nreverse\n\nthe order\n\nof all radios in the\n\ncascaded\n\nchain.\n\nThis is useful\n\nin a situation where there is a difference in CPRI line rate.\n\n## 8.1 Configuration\n\nCascaded radio configurations are represented in the site equipment file.\n\nConfiguration Example of Three-Sector 2x2 MIMO with Three Cascaded External Radios on\n\nBaseband units\n\nFigure 10   Configuration Example of Three-Sector 2x2 MIMO with Three Cascaded External Radios on\n\nBaseband units\n\nThis example configuration consists of the following:\n\n- Three cascaded external radios\n- Hardware connections and corresponding MO structure\n- A basic three-sector 2x2 MIMO configuration that has three cascaded external radios with the Cascadable Radio Units feature\n\n## 8.2 Cascaded Radio Units in Mixed Mode, FDD Only\n\nOne mixed mode radio at each end of the chain and multiple single-mode radios can be connected in a cascade chain. This configuration allows one standard to use different frequencies, and also to reduce equipment costs and simplify the antenna equipment setup.\n\nFor details and examples, see Supported Radio Capabilities.\n\nFigure 11   Configuration Example of Cascading in Mixed Mode\n\nSome AIR units can support different mixed mode configurations than standard internal or\n\nexternal radios, see\n\nMixed Mode All-In-One User\n\nGuide\n\nfor details.\n\n## 8.3 Supported Cascadable Radio Unit Configurations for Each Chain\n\nSupported cascadable radio configurations are described in Radio Node Configurations.\n\nAvailable bandwidth depends on CPRI used for other cascades. The total available bandwidth\n\ndepends on the CPRI bit rate, radio type, line rate, number and type of radio units, and other\n\nRAN features. The bandwidth for each radio is further divided if the radio uses more than one\n\nRF port (for example, 40 MHz means 2x20 MHz in case of two RF ports). See Radio Node Configurations for more information.\n\n## 8.4 Effect of Link and Radio Failure\n\nMultiple sectors can be affected by a link failure between two\n\nradios. The example of a three-sector, six-chain radio configuration\n\nwith 2x2 MIMO for each sector is shown in Figure 12. The failure of the link between radio 1 and radio 2 affects all\n\nthree sectors. The first sector is in a degraded state, while sectors\n\n2 and 3 are in a failed state.\n\nAutomatic radio restart and link recovery procedures are executed\n\nto re-establish the connection between the radios. Depending on the\n\nlink or radio fault condition, the connection to all the affected\n\nradios is re-established.\n\nRadio\n\nfailures do not affect the other radios in the chain if the CPRI interface to the radios is\n\nfunctional or until the radios are restarted. The effects of radio restarts are described in\n\nEffect on Traffic at Radio Restart.\n\nFigure 12   Effect of Link Failure\n\n## 8.5 Effect on Traffic at Radio Restart\n\nIf multiple sectors are associated with radios in a cascade chain, restart of radios of a\n\nparticular sector can affect the traffic of other sectors.\n\nRestart the sequence beginning with the radios that are closest\n\nto the Baseband unit and continue in a chain to the outer radios.\n\nThe outer radios are dependent on the connections from the inner radios.\n\n# Appendix A: Feature Change History\n\nThis section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the\n\nnetwork.\n\n## Appendix A.a: 18.Q1: Enhanced Radio Unit Cascading with Baseband R503\n\nEnhancement that enables more radio units to be cascaded with Baseband R503.\n\n| Feature Name:           | Cascadable Radio Units             |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 1820 R3                    |\n| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                   |\n| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400 R10                   |\n| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |\n| Access Type:            | LTE, WCDMA, GSM                    |\n\nThe enhancement enables more radio units to be cascaded with Baseband R503.

SINR measurements to determine if transmission over two layers is\n\npossible for supported UEs. If the SINR crosses a predefined threshold, the feature\n\nreconfigures the UE automatically. For more information, see Dynamic Uplink Switching Options.\n\nFigure 1   Port and Layer Switching Based on SINR Measurement\n\nPort and Layer Switching Process Based on SINR Measurement\n\nThe feature uses the following process to configure the UE for transmission over two\n\nlayers:\n\n1. The gNodeB schedules the UE for one-port transmission by default during RRC setup.\n2. The UE reports two-port capability to the gNodeB.\n3. The UE starts traffic.\n4. The gNodeB reconfigures the UE for two ports with RRC reconfiguration if the SINR is above the predefined threshold.\n5. The gNodeB schedules the UE for transmission over one or two layers in the upcoming uplink slots.\n\n## 3.1 Dynamic Uplink Switching Options\n\nThe feature supports dynamic switching options to adapt to changing channel\n\nconditions. Switching is determined by using SINR measurements and occurs if the SINR\n\ncrosses a predefined threshold.\n\nThe following uplink switching options are supported:\n\n- Layer switching\n- TX port switching\n- Waveform switching\n\nSwitching from two layer to transmission over one layer is also supported based on DTX\n\nobservations by the gNodeB. For more information, see Uplink Layer Switching for Dual SIM Dual Active UEs.\n\nPort switching can be configured with the\n\nUlWfPortSwitchUeCfg.ulPortSwitchFr1Mode attribute for different\n\nUE groups and power classes.\n\nIf the UlWfPortSwitchUeCfg.ulLayerSwitchQualThresh attribute is set\n\nfor full-power transmission UE power class in the case of 2Ports1layer configuration,\n\nthere is a compensation for non-full-power transmission UE power class like TDD\n\nPC1.5.\n\nIf the UlWfPortSwitchUeCfg.ulLayerSwitchQualThresh attribute is set\n\nfor non-full-power transmission UE power class like TDD PC1.5 in the case of\n\n2Ports1Layer configuration, the values used for port switching and layer switching keep\n\nthe same value. Otherwise, performance might degrade. For more information about UE\n\ngroups, see UE Grouping Framework. For more information about UE power\n\nclasses, see NR\n\nStandalone.\n\nSINR measurements are used for port switching by comparing threshold and hysteresis. The\n\nulPortSwitchTimeToTrigger attribute is used to avoid frequent UE\n\nreconfiguring.\n\nThe timer uses the ulPortSwitchTimeToTrigger attribute to ensure that\n\nthe SINR crosses the threshold stably.\n\nThe gNodeB uses the following configuration in good channel conditions:\n\n- Two-layer uplink transmission for capable UEs\n- Two-port transmission\n- CP-OFDM waveform transmission\n\nThe gNodeB uses the following configuration in poor channel conditions:\n\n- Single-layer transmission\n- Single-port transmission\n- DFTS-OFDM waveform transmission if possibleNote: The DFTS-OFDM Waveform in Uplink feature must be activated to enable using the DFTS-OFDM waveform. Otherwise, the CP-OFDM waveform is used in poor channel conditions as well.\n\nThe configurations for these use cases are shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2   Configurations for Good and Poor Channel Conditions\n\n## 3.2 Uplink Layer Switching for Dual SIM Dual Active UEs\n\nThis feature supports layer switching when one of the Tx ports of a Dual SIM Dual\n\nActive (DSDA) UE is muted.\n\nA DSDA UE can use two active SIM cards at the same time. If the Uplink Single-User MIMO\n\nfeature is activated on the gNodeB, DSDA UEs with two Tx ports can support transmission\n\nover two uplink layers.\n\nSometimes, a DSDA UE might suddenly remove its two-layer capability. This can happen, for\n\nexample, when the UE handles an LTE call, or when it mutes one of its Tx ports for some\n\nother reason. Muting a Tx port means that the UE does not use that port for the NR cell,\n\nthat is no NR signal is sent on that port.\n\nThis feature allows the gNodeB to detect when a UE Tx port is muted. When a Tx port is\n\nmuted, the gNodeB switches to transmission over one layer. Later, the gNodeB checks\n\nwhether transmission can be resumed over two ports.\n\nAn optimal operational process is shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. This process shows a scenario\n\nwhen the gNodeB detects whether a UE Tx port is muted and applies layer switching\n\naccordingly.\n\nFigure 3   Uplink Layer Switching to Transmission over One Layer\n\nFigure 4   Uplink Layer Switching to Transmission over Two Layers\n\n1. When the UE is configured for transmission over two layers, the gNodeB checks whether one of the Tx ports of the UE is muted.\n2. If one port is muted, the following actions are taken:\n    1. The gNodeB starts a timer. Note: The timer duration is different for each TDD pattern.\n    2. The gNodeB schedules the UE for transmission over one layer.\n3. When the timer expires, the gNodeB tries to schedule transmission over two layers for the UE. If this is successful, the gNodeB continues to schedule the UE for transmission over two layers.\n4. If not successful, the timer is restarted.\n\n# 4 Network Impact of Uplink Single-User MIMO\n\nThe feature increases uplink throughput and can provide better cell coverage in poor\n\nchannel conditions.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThe feature can provide the following benefits:\n\n- Better cell coverage for UEs on the cell edge with adaptive waveform switching.\n- Double peak throughput for UEs capable of two-layer uplink transmission.\n- Increased uplink spectrum efficiency and cell throughput.\n\nFor waveform switching, retainability can degrade because of the additional RRC\n\nsignaling for data inactive UEs in poor SINR conditions.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.\n\n# 5 Parameters of Uplink Single-User MIMO\n\nPort switching can be configured for each UE group with an attribute.

If the Uplink\n\nSingle-User MIMO feature is activated on the gNodeB, DSDA UEs with two Tx ports can\n\nsupport transmission over two uplink layers.\n\nUplink performance can degrade when a DSDA UE suddenly removes its two-layer\n\ncapability. This can happen, for example, when the UE handles an LTE call, or when\n\nit mutes one of its Tx ports for some other reason. Muting a Tx port means that the\n\nUE does not use that port for the NR cell, that is no NR signal is sent on that\n\nport.\n\nTo limit the performance degradation, this feature enhancement introduces a solution\n\nto detect when a UE Tx port is muted. When the gNodeB detects that a UE Tx port is\n\nmuted, it switches to transmission over one layer. Later, the gNodeB checks whether\n\ntransmission can be resumed over two ports.\n\nWith this feature enhancement, the uplink performance degradation is mitigated when\n\nthe UE suddenly mutes one of its Tx ports. The feature enhancement is applicable for\n\nMid-Band deployments.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nWhen this function is applied, the number of required retransmissions for the UE is\n\nlower. This means that the modulation and coding scheme for the UE can be higher. As\n\na result, throughput-related and BLER-related KPIs and PIs are improved. This\n\nimprovement can only be observed for UEs with two-layer and DSDA capability, during\n\nthe case described in Summary and Benefits.\n\nThe following ACK-related PM counters are increased, while the corresponding\n\nNACK-related PM counters are decreased at the same time:\n\n- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlAckQpsk\n- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlAck16Qam\n- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlAck64Qam\n- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlAck256Qam\n- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlNackQpsk\n- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlNack16Qam\n- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlNack64Qam\n- NRCellDU.pmMacHarqUlNack256Qam\n\nAs a result, the following BLER-related PIs are improved:\n\n- UL BLER per modulation for all HARQ transmissions Formula: 100 × pmMacHarqUlNackMod / (pmMacHarqUlNackMod + pmMacHarcUlAckMod)\n- UL BLER per modulation for initial HARQ transmissions Formula: 100 × pmMacHarqUlNackModInit / (pmMacHarqUlNackModInit + pmMacHarcUlAckModInit)\n\nThe NRCellDU.pmMacVolUl PM counter is increased. As a result the\n\nfollowing KPIs related to this counter are also improved:\n\n- Normalized Average UL MAC Cell Throughput considering successful PUSCH slot only\n- Average UL MAC Cell Throughput - fixed time normalized\n- Normalized UL MAC Cell Throughput considering actual PUSCH slot only\n- Average UL MAC UE Throughput\n\nOperation\n\nThe NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPuschMimoLayerDistr PM counter is\n\nmodified to step correctly for bin[1], so generally the counter is stepped less\n\nfrequently for this bin.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nHardware\n\nNo specific hardware requirements.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.\n\nRelated Information\n\nUplink Single-User MIMO\n\n## Appendix A.c: 23.Q1: UE Grouping Support for TX Port Switching with Uplink Single-User MIMO\n\nThe feature enhancement enables the separate configuration of port switching for\n\ndifferent UE groups.\n\n| Feature Name           | Uplink Single-User MIMO   |\n|------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5234              |\n| Value Package Name     | Peak Rate Evolution       |\n| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4005              |\n| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node       |\n| Access Type            | NR                        |\n| Impact at Upgrade      | Mandatory                 |\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nNo impact.\n\nOperation\n\nThe UlWfPortSwitch and the UlWfPortSwitchUeCfg\n\nMO classes are introduced.

Uplink\n\nweight depends on uplink layer coverage with the feature enhancement.\n\nThe Multi-Layer Coordination function of the NR Traffic Steering feature is updated\n\nto ensure that if the UE is in bad coverage where uplink SU-MIMO is not beneficial,\n\nthe UE is reconfigured to use uplink carrier aggregation with a Mid-Band and a\n\nLow-Band component carrier. The feature enhancement enables the Multi-Layer\n\nCoordination function to consider uplink layer coverage along with uplink weights\n\nfor the selection of the serving cell set.\n\nThe feature enhancement has the following benefits:\n\n- More efficient use of a scattered spectrum\n- Improved uplink UE throughput\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nIn a network where both the Uplink Single-User MIMO and the NR Uplink Carrier\n\nAggregation features are enabled and UEs support both features, the updated\n\nalgorithm might lead to the selection of different serving cell sets, which might\n\nimpact uplink performance. If the bandwidth of the Mid-Band cell is large enough\n\ncompared to the bandwidth of the Low-Band cell, uplink SU-MIMO is initially selected\n\ninstead of uplink carrier aggregation with a Mid-Band and a Low-Band component\n\ncarrier with the updated algorithm.\n\nThe Average UL MAC UE Throughput KPI might improve.\n\nThe following PM counters monitoring uplink resource block symbol utilization\n\nentities might be affected:\n\n- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPusch1Port1Layer\n- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPusch2Port1Layer\n- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPusch2Port2Layer\n- NRCellDU.pmRadioSchedUlSuMimoRankDistr\n- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPuschMimoLayerDistr\n- NRCellDU.pmMacRBSymUsedPuschMimoUserDistr\n\nThe following PM counters monitoring uplink carrier aggregation might be affected:\n\n- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigAttUl\n- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigSuccUl\n- NRCellCU.pmCaDeconfigAttUl\n- NRCellCU.pmCaDeconfigSuccUl\n- NRCellCU.pmCaConfigUlSumSaDistr\n- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlPCellCa\n- NRCellDU.pmPuschSchedActivityPCellCa\n- NRCellDU.pmMacOffloadVolUlSCell\n- NRCellDU.pmMacOffloadVolUlSCellExt\n- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlSCellExt\n- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlSCellExtBwp\n\nOperation\n\nThe feature enhancement uses the\n\nTrStSaNrFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrpUl2lCoverageThrOffset\n\nattribute for coverage measurements in the current PCell and candidate PCell to\n\ndetermine uplink two-layer coverage during the evaluations of the Multi-Layer\n\nCoverage function.\n\nThe feature enhancement uses the\n\nCaCellProfileUeCfg.ulCaConfigurationMode attribute to select\n\nthe configuration mode when the UE is selected with a band combination for uplink\n\ncarrier aggregation or uplink 1TX-2TX switching.

To find the correct user guide for these use cases, see Baseband Expansion, Migration, and Replacement User\n\nGuides Overview.\n\nHardware replace using ENM is performed when replacement of a Baseband Radio Node\n\nis required. A physical board (or the main processor board) in a node can be replaced\n\nwith a new one, without losing the configuration data.\n\nHardware replace is an automated configuration process, initiated through an Auto\n\nProvisioning project using ENM CLI or the Auto Provisioning UI. The configuration files\n\nand the License Key File (LKF) from the old Baseband unit are automatically transferred\n\nto the new Baseband unit by restoring from a node backup.\n\nThe estimated duration for the end-to-end scenario is 35 minutes.\n\n## 1.1 Prerequisites of Replacing Baseband Using ENM\n\n- A request for replacing a Baseband unit is done as a decision activity.\n\nSoftware-related and system prerequisites\n\n- ENM version 20.4 or later.\n- Access to ENM CLI or the Auto Provisioning UI.\n- Auto provisioning projects for the network element that is to be replaced are removed from ENM AP.\n\nHardware-related prerequisites\n\n- The new Baseband unit must be the same model as the replaced Baseband unit.\n- The serial number of the Baseband unit must be correct when entered in the system. If not, a rollback procedure is required.\n\n# 2 Methods of Replacing Baseband Using ENM\n\nReplacing a Baseband unit is done with one of the following methods.\n\nTable 1\n\n| Method                   | Benefits                                                                                                  | Limitations                                              |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Zero Touch (recommended) | Reduces the amount of on-site activities     Laptop is not required     No need to bring SIF file to site | DHCP and DNS infrastructure is required                  |\n| LMT                      | DHCP is not required                                                                                      | Laptop is required     SIF file must be uploaded on-site |\n\nA node hardware replace is executed by ordering a hardware replace project through the\n\nENM CLI.\n\nThe command triggers the hardware replacement flow and reconfigures the existing ENM node\n\nidentity with a new hardware serial number from the latest known configuration available\n\nin ENM.\n\nThe hardware replace command is ordered by dragging and dropping the hardware replace\n\nproject ZIP file into the ENM CLI.\n\nThe procedure is applicable for the following hardware:\n\n- Baseband Radio Nodes (LTE/WCDMA/GSM/Multistandard Mixed Mode)\n\nFor more information, see Auto Provisioning in the ENM Online\n\nHelp.\n\n## 2.1 End-to-End Workflow of Replacing Baseband Using ENM\n\nThe figure below describes the end-to-end workflow of the replace Baseband unit procedure using ENM.\n\nFigure 1   End-to-End Workflow of Replacing a Baseband unit Using\n\nENM\n\n# 3 Configuration of Baseband Radio Node\n\nremote integration engineer\n\n![Image](../images/114_1553-LZA7016014_1Uen.BA/additional_3_CP.png)\n\nThe following steps are performed by the ENM Operator off-site.\n\nIn the configuration phase, node-specific configuration files are created and the\n\nBaseband Radio Node replacement is ordered. The configuration phase includes the\n\nfollowing tasks:\n\n- Create a Replacement Project File.\n- Order the Replacement.\n\nTools\n\n- ENM\n- ZIP file builder\n- XML Validator\n\n## 3.1 Replacement Project File\n\nA replacement project file is a ZIP file that contains the required configurations. The\n\nfile is imported into the ENM CLI or the Auto Provisioning UI to trigger the\n\nreplacement.\n\nAn example of the replacement project file structure is shown\n\nbelow.\n\n```\n[replaceExample.zip]\n├── projectInfo.xml\n└── replaceNode1\n    └── nodeInfo.xml\n```\n\nFor more information about creating a replacement project, see the Auto Provisioning in\n\nENM online help.\n\n### 3.1.1 Create a Project Folder and a Project Information File\n\nSample Project Information Files are available using the\n\nap download -x command in ENM CLI, or in\n\nBaseband Radio Node library\n\n&gt; Initial Configuration\n\n.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Create an empty project folder.\n2. Create a new projectInfo.xml file within the empty project folder, or use a sample Project Information File.\n3. Update the template projectInfo.xml file according to the specific replacement project: Project name Description Creator\n\nExample 1   projectInfo.xml Example File\n\n```\n<projectInfoxmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"ProjectInfo.xsd\"><name>RadioNode_20Q4_HwReplace_LMT_User_1_proj1</name><description>Example of hardware replace project with LTE RadioNode nodes</description><creator>Ericsson</creator></projectInfo>\n```\n\n### 3.1.2 Create a Node Folder with a Node Information File\n\nThe node folder stores node-specific configuration within the project. It is\n\nrecommended to name the subfolder the same as the Logical Name of the node. Node\n\nfolders must be at the same level as the Project Information File.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Create a node folder for each node that is to be replaced. Place each folder in the project folder created in Create a Project Folder and a Project Information File.\n2. Create a Node Information File called nodeInfo.xml in each node folder. The file connects to the appropriate schema located in Baseband Radio Node library &gt; Initial Configuration . The schema can be downloaded from ENM using the ap download command. For more information about specific configuration, see ENM Online Help.\n\nExample 2   nodeInfo.xml Example File\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?><nodeInfoxmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"HardwareReplaceNodeInfo.xsd\"><name>Node-001</name><hardwareSerialNumber>SCB87654321</hardwareSerialNumber># Optional in hardware replace with Zero Touch<backup>backup.pkg.name</backup># Optional<defaultRouter>192.168.0.99</defaultRouter># Optional<security># Optional, only needed if subjectAltName differs in the new unit<ipSecurity><subjectAltName>123456789X.OperatorName.SE</subjectAltName># Mandatory within security tag<subjectName>1.2.3.4.a.b</subjectName># Optional</ipSecurity></security></nodeInfo>\n```\n\n#### 3.1.2.1 &lt;subjectAltName&gt; When Based on Hardware Serial Number\n\nIncluding the &lt;subjectAltName&gt; in the nodeInfo.xml\n\nfile updates the &lt;subjectAltName&gt; of a node when executing a hardware\n\nreplace. The IPSec node credentials are updated to reflect the new\n\n&lt;subjectAltName&gt;.\n\n### 3.1.3 Create the Project ZIP File\n\nSteps\n\n1. Select all the contents of the project folder.\n2. Create new ZIP file. Note: The Project Information File and all node folders must be located in the root folder of the project ZIP file.\n\n# 4 Replace Baseband Unit Using Zero Touch\n\n## 4.1 Prerequisites for Replacement of the Baseband Unit Using Zero Touch\n\n- The DHCP and DNS infrastructure is set up.

One license is required for each node. |\n\nSummary\n\nThis feature allows for mobility actions to be triggered for UEs that experience low\n\nperformance. UEs that experience low performance are moved from the NR standalone\n\nnetwork to the LTE network, which can increase UE performance and decrease load in\n\nthe NR cell.\n\nUE mobility is triggered if one of the following conditions is fulfilled:\n\n- High downlink RLC buffer age or packet volume\n- Low downlink and uplink restricted Medium Access Control (MAC) throughput\n\nThis feature works together with the Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function of the\n\nNR Traffic Steering feature. If the Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover\n\nfunction is enabled in the node, the aggregated bandwidth threshold provided by the\n\nfunction is used for this feature.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nFor more information on the Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function, see NR Traffic Steering.\n\nHandover procedures through the N26 interface are described in 3GPP TS\n\n23.502.\n\n# 2 Dependencies of NR Data-Aware Mobility\n\nThis feature has dependencies to other features and requirements for other network\n\nelements.\n\nFeature Dependencies\n\nTable 1   Feature Dependencies\n\n![Image](../images/201_22104-LZA7016017_1Uen.V/additional_3_CP.png)\n\n![Image](../images/201_22104-LZA7016017_1Uen.V/additional_3_CP.png)\n\n| Feature                                                                             | Feature Identity   | Access Type   | Relationship   | Relationship Scope      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Incoming NR IRAT Handover                                                           | FAJ 121 5118       | LTE           | Prerequisite   | Node-level prerequisite | The Incoming NR IRAT Handover feature must be active in the             target LTE cell for mobility actions to that LTE cell to be successful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Basic Voice over NR                                                                 | FAJ 121 5219       | NR            | Related        |                         | It is recommended to avoid using NR Data-Aware Mobility for             VoNR.

The feature provides configurable triggers that can be\n\nused both separately and together for flexible UE mobility from NR Standalone to LTE\n\nif the UE experiences poor performance in the NR standalone network. UE performance\n\ncan be affected by the distance from the antenna or the amount of traffic in the\n\ncell.\n\nThe feature introduces the following triggers for UE mobility:\n\n- High downlink RLC buffer age or packet volume\n- Low downlink and uplink restricted Medium Access Control (MAC) throughput\n\nThe triggers can be combined with the available cell set bandwidth threshold and the\n\nconfigurable B2 IRAT traffic steering measurement thresholds. These thresholds are\n\nprovided by the Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Mobility function of the NR Traffic\n\nSteering feature to target UEs selectively for mobility to LTE. The NR Data-Aware\n\nMobility feature does not consider the capacity of the layers in the LTE network.\n\nHowever, the available frequencies can be prioritized to prefer mobility to a\n\nspecific layer if the layer is in coverage.\n\nWhen the traffic load increases in the cells used by the UE, the downlink RLC buffer\n\nand the throughput for the UE can be affected, which results in reaching the\n\nthreshold for UE mobility. The UE moving away from the antenna can also cause higher\n\ndownlink RLC buffer packet volumes and reduced throughput.\n\nFigure 1   Operating Conditions of NR Data-Aware Mobility\n\nThe NR Data-Aware Mobility feature is intended to be used on NR coverage layers, as\n\nUEs on the coverage layers can experience poor performance. However, it is possible\n\nto use the feature in other conditions as well. UEs on NR capacity layers that have\n\nhigh load can also benefit from mobility to LTE networks. The feature can also be\n\nused to offload coverage layers selectively to allow more capacity for other UEs\n\nintended to stay in the NR standalone network on the coverage layer.\n\nEvaluation to Start NR Data-Aware Mobility\n\nWhen the UE connects to the cell from idle or inactive state, the gNodeB triggers the\n\nNR Data-Aware Mobility feature after the Multi-Layer Coordination function of the NR\n\nTraffic Steering feature finishes. The feature is also triggered periodically if\n\nperiodic Multi-Layer Coordination is enabled in the Dynamic Cell Set Change during\n\nMobility function.\n\nIf downlink RLC or uplink buffer monitoring is enabled for NR-DC, the NR Data-Aware\n\nMobility feature is not triggered for the UE capable of NR-DC.\n\nWhen the NR Data-Aware Mobility feature is triggered, the monitoring procedure starts\n\nwith the configured thresholds, and mobility actions are considered if a monitoring\n\nreport is received.\n\nOperational Process of NR Data-Aware Mobility\n\nFigure 2   Operational Sequence Diagram of NR Data-Aware Mobility\n\n1. When the Multi-Layer Coordination procedure finishes, the gNodeB triggers the NR Data-Aware Mobility feature. For more information on the Multi-Layer Coordination function, see NR Traffic Steering.\n2. The gNodeB evaluates if monitoring for the UE can be started by the feature. The following conditions must be fulfilled to start the monitoring procedure: The NR Data-Aware Mobility feature is activated. At least one type of monitoring by the NR Data-Aware Mobility feature is configured for the UE. NR-DC is not established for the UE. The UE is not in the Search Zone of the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage function of the NR Mobility feature. No IRAT traffic steering inter-system mobility measurements are configured for the UE. If the Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function of the NR Traffic Steering feature is enabled, the available bandwidth must be equal to or below the configured threshold. For more information on the Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function, see NR Traffic Steering.\n3. The gNodeB checks and starts the types of monitoring configured for the UE. The following types of monitoring can be configured: Downlink Radio Link Control (RLC) buffer Downlink throughput Uplink throughput Note: It is possible to configure all monitoring types to run simultaneously for the UE.\n4. If downlink RLC or uplink buffer monitoring is ongoing for the UE in NR-DC, the buffer monitoring function of the NR Data-Aware Mobility feature is not started. If downlink RLC or uplink buffer monitoring is enabled for NR-DC, the NR Data-Aware Mobility feature is not triggered for the UE capable of NR-DC. For more information about NR-DC downlink RLC buffer monitoring, see NR-NR Dual Connectivity.\n5. If any of the monitored buffer values exceeds the configured threshold, or if any of the monitored downlink or uplink throughput values are below the defined throughput threshold, the gNodeB performs the following actions: The gNodeB stops the monitoring type corresponding to the threshold. The gNodeB initiates the IRAT traffic steering measurement procedure for the UE. For more information about the IRAT traffic steering measurement procedure, see NR Traffic Steering. The following conditions are checked before the IRAT traffic steering measurement procedure starts: No IRAT traffic steering inter-system mobility measurements are configured for the UE. NR-DC is not established for the UE. The UE is not in the Search Zone of the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage function of the NR Mobility feature. If the Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function of the NR Traffic Steering feature is enabled, the available bandwidth must be equal to or below the configured threshold. For more information on the Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function, see NR Traffic Steering.\n6. The IRAT traffic steering evaluation to start monitoring is repeated periodically for UEs connected to the cell if the Dynamic Cell Set Change during Mobility function of the NR Traffic Steering feature is enabled in the cell. For more information on the Dynamic Cell Set Change during Mobility function, see NR Traffic Steering.\n\n## 3.1 Operation of Downlink RLC Buffer Monitoring for NR Data-Aware Mobility\n\nThe NR Data-Aware Mobility feature monitors downlink RLC buffer use to trigger\n\nmobility actions for UEs.\n\nThe feature monitors downlink RLC buffer use by the UE based on the following\n\nthresholds:\n\n- The age of the oldest SDU packet in the RLC queue. This threshold can be configured through the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.dataAwareMobDlPktAgeThr attribute.\n- The volume of the packets in the RLC queue. This threshold can be configured through the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.dataAwareMobDlPktVolThr attribute.\n\nIf only one of the threshold attributes is configured to have a value higher than\n\n0, the downlink RLC buffer monitoring procedure is started. When\n\nthe configured threshold is exceeded, the IRAT traffic steering measurement procedure is\n\ntriggered.\n\nIf both threshold attributes are configured to have a value higher than\n\n0, the downlink RLC buffer monitoring procedure is started. When\n\nboth configured thresholds are exceeded, the IRAT traffic steering measurement procedure\n\nis triggered.\n\nDownlink RLC buffer monitoring applies to all DRBs of the UE. If the downlink RLC buffer\n\nmonitoring threshold is reached for one DRB of the UE, the monitoring process is stopped\n\nfor all other DRBs for that UE, and the IRAT traffic steering measurement procedure is\n\ntriggered.\n\n## 3.2 Operation of Throughput Monitoring\n\nThe throughput monitoring procedure, consisting of throughput filtering and\n\nthroughput monitoring, is triggered every second.\n\nAdjustable Parameters of Throughput Filtering\n\nThroughput monitoring by the NR Data-Aware Mobility feature uses PM event data for\n\nMedium Access Control (MAC) throughput restricted by the air interface. The time and\n\nvolume data in the gNodeB for the restricted MAC throughput is sampled every second.\n\nDownlink throughput data is sampled for each DRB, and uplink throughput data is\n\nsampled for the UE. The following calculations are used for downlink time and volume\n\nsamples:\n\n- DlTime=MacTimeDlDrb-MacOverlapTimeDlDrbExtSCell\n- DlVol=MacVolDlDrb+MacVolDlDrbOverlapLastSlot\n\nThe following calculations are used for uplink time and volume samples:\n\n- UlTime=MacTimeUlResUe\n- UlVol=MacVolUlResUe\n\nThe time and volume samples are also used by the following PM counters:\n\n- NRCellDU.pmMacOverlapTimeDlDrbExtSCell\n- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeDlDrb\n- NRCellDU.pmMacTimeUlResUe\n- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrb\n- NRCellDU.pmMacVolDlDrbOverlapLastSlot\n- NRCellDU.pmMacVolUlResUe\n\nThe PM event data is processed through a throughput filtering algorithm to reduce the\n\nimpact from data bursts. This improves the reliability of the throughput data.\n\nThe throughput filtering algorithm is configured separately for downlink and uplink\n\nthroughput. The following attributes are used to configure the algorithm:\n\n- The TrStSaCellProfile.dataAwareMobDlThpFilterCoeff and the TrStSaCellProfile.dataAwareMobUlThpFilterCoeff attributes are used to configure the filter coefficient.\n- The TrStSaCellProfile.dataAwareMobDlThpFilterTime and the TrStSaCellProfile.dataAwareMobUlThpFilterTime attributes are used to configure the filter time.\n- The TrStSaCellProfile.dataAwareMobDlLowThpDuration and the TrStSaCellProfile.dataAwareMobUlLowThpDuration attributes are used to configure the filter duration.\n\nThe filter coefficient defines a smoothing factor in the exponential filtering of the\n\ndownlink and uplink throughput samples. The filtered throughput is calculated as the\n\nfiltered volume divided by the filtered time. A high value set for the filter\n\ncoefficient introduces inertia for quick changes in the throughput samples.\n\nFigure 3 shows an example of filtered\n\nthroughput values calculated using different filter coefficient values.\n\nFigure 3   Example of Filtered Throughput\n\nThe filter time is defined as the time period that must be exceeded by the filtered\n\ntime data for a throughput calculation to be performed. The filter time is used to\n\nensure that the air interface is the bottleneck for the UE performance. A higher\n\nvalue configured for the filter time results in improved accuracy of the throughput\n\nmonitoring procedure for the UE.\n\nIf the filter time is set to 1,000 ms, the throughput buffer is\n\ncontinuously full during the one-second evaluation period. If the filter time is set\n\nto 0 ms, the throughput calculation is performed independently from\n\nthe filtered time value, which can increase the probability of triggering\n\nunnecessary IRAT inter-system mobility.\n\nThe filter duration is defined as the number of consecutive one-second samples\n\nrequired for throughput monitoring if the threshold for low throughput is exceeded.\n\nThe filter duration can be set to a value of 1-10 s to mitigate\n\ndata bursts with lower frequencies.\n\nConfiguration of Throughput Monitoring\n\nThroughput filtering is started when the UE connects to the cell to allow enough time\n\nfor the exponential filtering algorithm to smooth the data before throughput\n\nmonitoring starts for the UE. This improves the accuracy of the throughput\n\nmonitoring results, especially when throughput monitoring is started for the UE\n\nafter the Multi-Layer Coordination procedure ends.\n\nThe throughput monitoring evaluation is performed after the throughput filtering\n\nalgorithm smooths the data, with the same one-second periodicity used by the\n\nthroughput filtering algorithm. To consider the threshold value exceeded, the\n\nfollowing conditions must be met:\n\n- The filtered throughput must be less than the value configured for the corresponding throughput threshold attribute.\n- The filtered throughput must fulfill the conditions defined by the filter duration configured for the gNodeB.\n\nThe thresholds for low throughput in both downlink and uplink throughput can be\n\nconfigured through the following attributes:\n\n- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.dataAwareMobLowDlThpThr\n- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.dataAwareMobLowUlThpThr\n\nThe thresholds for both downlink and uplink throughput can be used at the same\n\ntime, but it is sufficient for only one of the thresholds to be exceeded to trigger\n\nthe IRAT traffic steering measurement procedure.\n\n## 3.3 UE Group Handling in NR Data-Aware Mobility\n\nThe feature supports the UE grouping framework.\n\nThe following configuration attributes used by the NR Data-Aware Mobility feature are\n\nadapted to the UE grouping framework:\n\n- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.aggregatedBwThreshold\n- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.bwTrigISHoEnabled\n- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.bwTrigISHoTriggerQuantity\n- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.dataAwareMobDlPktAgeThr\n- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.dataAwareMobDlPktVolThr\n- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.dataAwareMobLowDlThpThr\n- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.dataAwareMobLowUlThpThr\n- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB2\n- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB2AddTargEval\n- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB2\n- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB2AddTargEval\n- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB2\n- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB2AddTargEval\n- TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB2Offsets\n- TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB2Offsets\n- TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB2Offsets\n- UeMCEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.connModeAllowedPCell\n- UeMCEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.connModePrioPCell\n\nThe attributes\n\nare\n\nread from the MO instances based on the UE groups the UE belongs\n\nto.\n\nWhen the UE groups that the UE belongs to change, the change can result in the selection\n\nof a new instance of one or more MO classes that contain the listed attributes. The\n\nfollowing results are possible:\n\n- If the UE is configured with an ongoing B2 measurement, and any of the listed attributes has a different value because of the selection of another MO instance, the B2 measurement is removed from the UE.\n- If downlink RLC buffer or throughput monitoring is ongoing in the gNodeB when the UE groups that the UE belongs to change, the monitoring procedure is stopped. The evaluation to start monitoring the downlink RLC buffer or the throughput can be triggered when the periodic interval timer for the Dynamic Cell Set Change during Mobility function of the NR Traffic Steering feature ends. For more information, see NR Traffic Steering.\n\nThe UE group support for this feature is controlled by the User- and Service-Specific\n\nMobility feature. If the User- and Service-Specific Mobility feature is not activated,\n\nconfiguration data is taken from the Base instances of the following MO\n\nclasses:\n\n- TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg\n- TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg\n- UeMCEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg\n\nFor more information, see User- and Service-Specific Mobility.\n\n## 3.4 Interaction with Other Features\n\nB2 measurements are removed from the UE if ongoing B2 measurements exist\n\nand\n\nthe UE group support-related configuration data of one or more of the following features\n\nchanges because of a UE group change:\n\n- UE Group Support for NR DL Carrier Aggregation\n- UE Group Support for NR Uplink Carrier Aggregation\n- UE Group Support for Multi-Layer Coordination\n\nRelated Information\n\nNR DL Carrier Aggregation\n\nNR Uplink Carrier Aggregation\n\nNR Traffic Steering\n\n# 4 Network Impact of NR Data-Aware Mobility\n\nThis feature can affect the number of connected UEs and the number of handover\n\nattempts and RwRs.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThis feature might impact the number of connected UEs configured in the NR standalone\n\ndeployment, depending on the used\n\nconfiguration,\n\nand whether the Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function of the NR Traffic\n\nSteering feature is enabled in the node.\n\nIf the Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function is enabled in the node when\n\nthe NR Data-Aware Mobility feature is activated, the following impact can be\n\nexpected:\n\n- The number of connected UEs might increase in the NR standalone network.\n- The number of handover attempts and RwRs to the LTE network might decrease.\n\nIf the Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function is disabled in the node\n\nwhen the NR Data-Aware Mobility feature is activated, the following impact can be\n\nexpected:\n\n- The number of connected UEs might decrease in the NR standalone network.\n- The number of handover attempts and RwRs to the LTE network might increase.\n\nInterfaces\n\nThe feature affects the following interfaces:\n\n| NG   |    | The feature uses NGAP control signaling for handover procedures.

After initial configuration, the feature can\n\nbe further optimized for the specific network environment.\n\nPrerequisites\n\n- All of the following MOs relevant for the configuration of the NR Data-Aware Mobility feature are created: EUtranCellRelation EUtranFreqRelation EUtranFrequency NRCellCU NRCellDU TrStSaCellProfile TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfile TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg UeMCEUtranFreqRelProfile UeMCEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg\n- E-UTRAN frequency relations and E-UTRAN cell relations are configured for IRAT mobility.\n- The Measurement Gap-Aware NR Scheduling feature is active in the node and configured to support LTE measurements.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Configure the trigger quantity to be used for B2 measurements through the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.bwTrigISHoTriggerQuantity attribute. Table 5 Supported Trigger Quantities for B2 Measurements Attribute Value Description RSRP RSRP is used as the trigger quantity. RSRQ RSRQ is used as the trigger quantity. SINR\\_FALLBACK\\_RSRP If the UE supports SINR measurements for NR and E-UTRAN frequencies, SINR is used as the trigger quantity. If the UE does not support SINR measurements for NR and E-UTRAN frequencies, the function falls back to using RSRP as the trigger quantity. SINR\\_FALLBACK\\_RSRQ If the UE supports SINR measurements for NR and E-UTRAN frequencies, SINR is used as the trigger quantity. If the UE does not support SINR measurements for NR and E-UTRAN frequencies, the function falls back to using RSRQ as the trigger quantity.\n2. Configure the E-UTRAN frequency candidate measurement with the following attributes corresponding to the trigger quantity chosen in the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.bwTrigISHoTriggerQuantity attribute: TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB2 TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB2 TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB2 If the SINR\\_FALLBACK\\_RSRP or the SINR\\_FALLBACK\\_RSRQ value is used for the IntraFreqMCCellProfileUeCfg.betterSpCellTriggerQuantity attribute, measurements must be configured for both SINR and the other quantity to be used as fallback. Table 6 Configurable Struct Members for the B2 E-UTRAN Frequency Candidate Measurement Struct Member Description hysteresis The hysteresis value is used to prevent the retriggering of B2 measurements if the trigger quantity fluctuates close to the threshold1 value. threshold1(1) The RSRP, RSRQ, or SINR threshold value for the serving cell during the B2 E-UTRAN frequency candidate measurement. threshold2EUtra(2) The RSRP, RSRQ, or SINR threshold2 value for the E-UTRAN candidate cell during the B2 E-UTRAN frequency candidate measurement. timeToTrigger The timeToTrigger value defines how long the threshold requirements must be fulfilled for before the B2 E-UTRAN frequency candidate measurement report is sent by the UE. (1) The threshold1 struct member can be adjusted through the TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB2Offsets, TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB2Offsets or TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB2Offsets attributes. (2) The threshold2EUtra struct member can be adjusted through the TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB2Offsets, TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB2Offsets or TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB2Offsets attributes. Note: The cell-specific offset that is configured through the EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffsetEUtran attribute is part of thethreshold2EUtra triggering condition for the B2 measurement reports.\n3. Define the E-UTRAN frequency relations where the UE is allowed to search for a PCell candidate.\n    1. Set the EUtranFreqRelation.ueMCEUtranFreqRelProfileRef attribute to refer to the given UeMCEUtranFreqRelProfile MO instance.\n    2. Set the UeMCEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.connModeAllowedPCell attribute that is associated with the UeMCEUtranFreqRelProfile MO instance to true.\n4. Optional: Optimize the configuration according to the network requirements with any of the following optimization options: Optimization Option Description Option 1: Prevent Handover to a Specific E-UTRAN Cell Handover can be prevented to specific LTE cells. Option 2: Prevent UE from Reporting an E-UTRAN Cell on a Specific E-UTRAN Frequency The gNodeB can be configured to prevent the UE from reporting an LTE cell on a specific E-UTRAN frequency. Option 3: Configure an E-UTRAN Cell-Specific Measurement Offset The conditions that trigger B2 measurement reports can be adjusted for a specific LTE cell on a given E-UTRAN frequency by applying a cell-specific offset. Option 4: Configure an E-UTRAN Frequency-Specific Measurement Threshold Offset The B2 measurement report threshold values can be adjusted by applying a B2 measurement report threshold offset for a specific E-UTRAN frequency. Option 5: Configure Measurement Priority for an E-UTRAN Frequency E-UTRAN frequency measurement priorities can be configured according to preferences. Option 6: Configure Additional Target Evaluation An additional reported quantity can be configured to be evaluated for B2 measurement reports.\n5. Set the following attributes to reference the corresponding MO profiles, if not set already: Table 7 MO Profile References Reference Attribute MO Profile NRCellCU.trStSaCellProfileRef TrStSaCellProfile EUtranFreqRelation.trStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileRef TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfile EUtranFreqRelation.ueMCEUtranFreqRelProfileRef UeMCEUtranFreqRelProfile\n6. Optional: Set the value of the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.bwTrigISHoEnabled attribute to true, and configure the aggregated NR bandwidth threshold through the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.aggregatedBwThreshold attribute.\n7. Set at least one of the following attributes to a value larger than 0 to configure downlink RLC buffer monitoring: TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.dataAwareMobDlPktAgeThr TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.dataAwareMobDlPktVolThr If only one of the threshold attributes is set to a value larger than 0, downlink RLC buffer monitoring is started when that threshold value is exceeded. If both threshold attributes are set to a value larger than 0, downlink RLC buffer monitoring is started only if both threshold values are exceeded.\n8. Set at least one of the following attributes to a value larger than 0 to configure downlink and uplink throughput monitoring: TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.dataAwareMobLowDlThpThr TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.dataAwareMobLowUlThpThr Note: Downlink and uplink throughput monitoring can be used together with downlink RLC buffer monitoring.\n\nResults\n\nThe gNodeB starts monitoring of the selected quantities, and triggers IRAT mobility\n\nto LTE if the threshold values are reached.\n\n### 9.1.1 Configuration Management of NR Data-Aware Mobility\n\nThe configuration of this feature is based on MO attributes, including attributes\n\nthat reference MO profiles.\n\nFigure 4   MO Relations for NR Data-Aware Mobility\n\n### 9.1.2 Optimization Options\n\n#### 9.1.2.1 Option 1: Prevent Handover to a Specific E-UTRAN Cell\n\nHandover can be prevented to specific E-UTRAN cells.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Set the EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute to false for each E-UTRAN cell relation for which a handover must be prevented. Note: The EUtranCellRelation.isHoAllowed attribute affects all features and functions that trigger handovers to the specific E-UTRAN cell.\n\n#### 9.1.2.2 Option 2: Prevent UE from Reporting an E-UTRAN Cell on a Specific E-UTRAN Frequency\n\nThe gNodeB can be configured to ensure that the UE avoids reporting an E-UTRAN cell\n\non a specific E-UTRAN frequency.\n\nIf\n\ntriggering\n\na handover to a specific E-UTRAN\n\nfrequency must\n\nbe avoided, it is possible to block such an E-UTRAN frequency with\n\na large B2\n\nmeasurement\n\nthreshold offset. This way, the UE does not report E-UTRAN cells\n\non the specific E-UTRAN frequency.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Create a TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfile MO instance for the given E-UTRAN frequency relation, or use the auto-created MO instance.\n2. Set the EUtranFreqRelation.trStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileRef attribute to refer to the TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfile MO instance.\n3. Set the threshold2EUtraOffset struct member of the following attributes to the maximum value of 100: TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB2Offsets TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB2Offsets TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB2Offsets The B2 measurement threshold that is sent to the UE is calculated through the following formula: TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB2 + 100 TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB2 + 100 TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB2 + 100\n\nResults\n\nThe UE reports no B2 measurements for E-UTRAN cells on\n\nthe given E-UTRAN frequency.\n\n#### 9.1.2.3 Option 3: Configure an E-UTRAN Cell-Specific Measurement Offset\n\nThe conditions that trigger B2\n\nmeasurements\n\ncan be adjusted for a specific E-UTRAN cell on a given E-UTRAN frequency\n\nby applying a cell-specific\n\noffset when RSRP is\n\nused as the trigger quantity.\n\nThe cell-specific offset is part of the conditions that trigger the\n\nB2\n\nmeasurement report. The offset is applied for all\n\nfeatures and\n\nfunctions that use\n\nB1\n\nor\n\nB2\n\nmeasurements\n\nwhen RSRP is used as the trigger quantity.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Configure a cell-specific offset for an E-UTRAN cell relation with the EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffset attribute.\n\n#### 9.1.2.4 Option 4: Configure an E-UTRAN Frequency-Specific Measurement Threshold Offset\n\nThe\n\nB2\n\nmeasurement\n\nthreshold values can be adjusted by applying a\n\nB2\n\nmeasurement\n\nthreshold offset for a specific E-UTRAN frequency.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Create a TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfile\n2. Set the EUtranFreqRelation.trStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileRef attribute to refer to the TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfile MO instance. MO instance for the given E-UTRAN frequency relation, or use the auto-created MO instance.\n3. Set the TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB2Offsets, TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB2Offsets, and TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB2Offsets attributes to a suitable value. The B2 measurement threshold that is sent to the UE is the sum of the following attributes, depending on the configured trigger quantity for the measurement: The TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB2 and the TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB2Offsets attributes The TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB2 and the TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB2Offsets attributes The TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB2 and the TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB2Offsets attributes\n\n#### 9.1.2.5 Option 5: Configure Measurement Priority for an E-UTRAN Frequency\n\nE-UTRAN frequency measurement priorities can be configured according to\n\npreferences.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Configure the priority for an E-UTRAN frequency relation with the UeMCEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.connModePrioPCell attribute. Note: This attribute affects all features and functions that use E-UTRAN frequency priorities.\n\nResults\n\nA priority value is assigned to the frequency.\n\n#### 9.1.2.6 Option 6: Configure Additional Target Evaluation\n\nThe gNodeB can be configured to evaluate a reported quantity that is different from\n\nthe configured trigger quantity in the B2 measurement report.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Configure the reported quantity to be evaluated through one of the following attributes corresponding to the trigger quantity configured through the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.bwTrigISHoTriggerQuantity attribute: TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB2AddTargEval TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB2AddTargEval TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB2AddTargEval If the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.bwTrigISHoTriggerQuantity attribute is configured with a different trigger quantity than the trigger quantity configured for the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature in any neighboring LTE cell, it is recommended to configure the additional target evaluation for that reported quantity in the cell. This reduces the risk of the Bandwidth-Triggered Inter-System Handover function moving the UE to a cell where the UE is immediately placed in the Search Zone of the Mobility Control at Poor Coverage feature.\n2. Configure the threshold for the evaluation of the configured reported quantity. The evaluation uses the same threshold used by the UE if the reported quantity is configured as the trigger quantity. The threshold is calculated as the sum of the other configuration attributes. For RSRP, the threshold is calculated in the following way: The values of the following struct members are added: The threshold2EUtra struct member in the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB2 attribute The hysteresis struct member in the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB2 attribute The threshold2EUtraOffset struct member in the TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrpPCellCandidateB2Offsets attribute The value of the EUtranCellRelation.cellIndividualOffset attribute is subtracted. For RSRQ, the threshold is calculated as the sum of the values of the following struct members: threshold2EUtra in the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB2 attribute hysteresis in the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB2 attribute threshold2EUtraOffset in the TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.rsrqPCellCandidateB2Offsets attribute For SINR, the threshold is calculated as the sum of the values of the following struct members: The threshold2EUtra struct member in the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB2 attribute The hysteresis struct member in the TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB2 attribute The threshold2EUtraOffset struct member in the TrStSaEUtranFreqRelProfileUeCfg.sinrPCellCandidateB2Offsets attribute Note: If the reported value to be evaluated is set to SINR\\_FALLBACK\\_RSRQ, the evaluation threshold must be configured for both SINR and RSRQ.\n\nResults\n\nWhen a B2 measurement report is received, the gNodeB evaluates the reported value of\n\nthe specified quantity. The gNodeB only configures the UE to perform handover to the\n\nreported cell if the reported value is above the configured additional target\n\nevaluation threshold for B2 measurements.\n\n## 9.2 Recommended Configuration for Downlink RLC Buffer Monitoring\n\nThe Downlink RLC Buffer Monitoring function exists for both the NR-NR Dual\n\nConnectivity feature and the NR Data-Aware Mobility feature.\n\nIt is not possible to have the Downlink RLC Buffer monitoring functions of both the NR-NR\n\nDual Connectivity and the NR Data-Aware Mobility features ongoing in the gNodeB at the\n\nsame time for the same UE.\n\nIf buffer monitoring is enabled for both features, and they are active in the same node,\n\nthe buffer monitoring of the NR Data-Aware Mobility feature might be blocked by the\n\nbuffer monitoring of the NR-NR Dual Connectivity feature. To avoid this, the following\n\nconfiguration is required:\n\n- The TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.dataAwareMobDlPktAgeThr attribute must be set to a higher value than the value of the NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcSetupDlPktAgeThr attribute.\n- The TrStSaCellProfileUeCfg.dataAwareMobDlPktVolThr attribute must be set to a higher value than the value of the NrdcMnCellProfileUeCfg.nrdcSetupDlPktVolThr attribute.\n\n## 9.3 Recommended Configuration for Throughput Monitoring\n\nThe feature can be configured to filter out data bursts in the throughput calculation\n\nfor more reliable monitoring.\n\nThe throughput filtering process of the NR Data-Aware Mobility feature operates the same\n\nway for both downlink and uplink monitoring. The following information can be configured\n\nfor the throughput monitoring process:\n\n- Filter coefficient\n- Filter time\n- Filter duration\n\nThe filter coefficient is used to control how quickly changes or noise in the throughput\n\nmeasurements affect the filtered throughput. The recommended filter coefficient value is\n\nbetween 0.6-0.8. The following attributes can be used to configure the\n\nfilter coefficient for downlink and uplink throughput:\n\n- TrStSaCellProfile.dataAwareMobDlThpFilterCoeff\n- TrStSaCellProfile.dataAwareMobUlThpFilterCoeff\n\nThe filter time is used to ensure that the air interface is the bottleneck for the UE\n\nperformance. A higher configured value for the filter time improves the accuracy of the\n\nthroughput monitoring for the UE.\n\nIt is not recommended to set the filter time to 0 ms. It is recommended\n\nto set the filter time to 200 ms, and later increase the value to\n\nimprove throughput monitoring in cases of higher user impact and larger amounts of sent\n\ndata. The following attributes can be used to configure the filter time for downlink and\n\nuplink throughput:\n\n- TrStSaCellProfile.dataAwareMobDlThpFilterTime\n- TrStSaCellProfile.dataAwareMobUlThpFilterTime\n\nThe filter duration is used to improve flexibility in reducing the sensitivity to short\n\nperiods of lower throughput. The recommended starting value for the filter duration is\n\n1 s. The following attributes can be used to configure the filter\n\nduration for downlink and uplink throughput:\n\n- TrStSaCellProfile.dataAwareMobDlLowThpDuration\n- TrStSaCellProfile.dataAwareMobUlLowThpDuration\n\n## 9.4 Recommended Configuration for Data-Aware Carrier Management\n\nIf the Data-Aware Carrier Management feature is also active in the node, it is\n\nrecommended to adjust the configuration used for that feature.\n\nWhen the NR Data-Aware Mobility feature is used together with the Data-Aware Carrier\n\nManagement feature and throughput monitoring is enabled for UEs, the Data-Aware Carrier\n\nManagement feature is recommended to be configured in a specific way. The Data-Aware\n\nCarrier Management feature\n\nmust\n\nbe configured to activate SCells for UEs that either send or receive a large amount of\n\ndata. This configuration reduces the chance that UEs are moved to LTE\n\nif\n\nthe NR cell can provide better throughput when the SCells are activated.\n\nFor more information on configuring the Data-Aware Carrier Management feature, see Data-Aware Carrier Management.",

The two new\n\npre-defined COM User Roles allow field technicians to do common tasks without having\n\nfull access to the entire MOM. Currently such tasks either require an administrator\n\nrole or a Maintenance User account, therefore the introduced roles will serve as a\n\nsolution to this issue.\n\nThe following characteristics apply to the roles:\n\n- Users with the Diagnostic\\_Application\\_Troubleshooter role will be capable to execute health-checks, which is otherwise limited to read-only operations.\n- Users with the Advanced\\_Application\\_Troubleshooter role will be capable to lock or unlock cells and perform an NE restart.\n\nAssigning both roles to user profiles creates a combination of the two roles that\n\nwill provide sufficient privileges for advanced field technicians to perform a\n\ncomplete set of operations.\n\nThe OAM and Node Security feature is introduced to NR and LTE base packages to\n\nprevent security enhancements from being handled as system improvements.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nNo impact.\n\nOperation\n\nNo impact.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nHardware\n\nNo specific hardware requirements.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.\n\nChapter ita1670431804336\n\n### 2.1.2 23.Q1: Backhaul Turn Up Testing\n\nThe feature can be used to check if the transport network provides the expected\n\nbandwidth before putting a newly installed RBS into service.\n\n| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5566                                            | FAJ 121 5566                                            |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Value Package Name     | NR Base Package                                         | LTE Base Package                                        |\n| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 4002                                            | FAJ 801 0400                                            |\n| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                     | Baseband Radio Node                                     |\n| Access Type            | NR                                                      | LTE                                                     |\n| Licensing              | Non-license-controlled feature.

To avoid network impact, it is recommended to use this feature before\n\nthe RBS is taken into service.\n\nThis feature supports up to four sessions simultaneously. The total possible\n\nthroughput is up to 3 Gbps.\n\nOperation\n\nThe throughput measurement is triggered by running the ranperf\n\nEricsson CLI command.\n\nWith this feature, the process of an RBS installation has the following steps:\n\n1. Installing the upgrade package\n2. Locking cells to prohibit traffic\n3. Measuring throughput from the RBS\n4. Measuring throughput to the RBS\n5.

This feature introduces a mechanism to detect\n\nfalse base stations. It collects and prepares data for security checks without the\n\nuse of additional hardware components.\n\nData is collected from the UE according to 3GPP specifications. The following\n\nmeasurement types are supported:\n\n- Inter-frequency and intra-frequency E-UTRAN\n- UTRAN\n- GERAN\n\nSecurity-Initiated PM events are generated based on received measurements reports.\n\nThese events are stored in the eNodeB and are transferred to ENM in the following\n\nways:\n\n- In the Cell Trace\n- In the UE Trace\n- In the Cell Trace and the UE Trace\n\nThe collected data is analyzed in the ESM and compared with the legal network\n\ntopology stored in ENM to detect attacks on the network.\n\nThe feature has the following benefits:\n\n- Attacks on network resources are prevented. This improves network security for the operator.\n- Data interception and phishing is prevented. This improves network security for the subscriber.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThe feature affects network load in the following ways:\n\n- The feature generates RRC signaling between the eNodeB and the UE, which increases the load on the Uu interface. The load is increased when UE measurements are started and stopped, and when the UE sends measurement reports to the eNodeB.\n- Each incoming measurement report from the UE generates a PM event, which increases the load on the eNodeB.\n- The increased number of PM events increases the load on the transport network when the events are transmitted to ENM.\n\nThe feature must be configured and used in a way that minimizes the following effects\n\non performance:\n\n| Throughput and latency   |    | The increased uplink RRC signaling can decrease throughput and                                 increase latency. This is because RRC signaling has scheduling                                 priority over user data. Measurement gaps can also decrease                                 throughput and increase latency.   |\n|--------------------------|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                          |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Retainability            |    | An increased number of dropped calls can be expected when this                                 feature is used.

The scheduler can order less than the\n\ndefault full output power per PRB for users when the resulting lower output power\n\nand better EVM together provide improved performance.\n\nThe observability can be monitored with the following PM counters:\n\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrb\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrb\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrbQci\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmPdcpVolDlDrbQci\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmRadioThpVolDl\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmRadioThpVolDl\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmMacHarqDlAck256qam\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmMacHarqDlAck256qam\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmMacHarqDlNack256qam\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmMacHarqDlNack256qam\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmMacHarqDlDtx256qam\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmMacHarqDlDtx256qam\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeThpDlDistr\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeThpDlDistr\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmEbsRbsRrcConnReconfAtt\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmEbsRbsRrcConnReconfAtt\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmEbsRbsRrcConnReconfSucc\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmEbsRbsRrcConnReconfSucc\n\nThe performance can be observed through downlink throughput and BLER variation\n\ncompared with legacy, which could be observed through the following KPIs:\n\n- Average DL MAC Cell Throughput - fixed time normalized\n- Normalized Average DL MAC Cell Throughput considering traffic\n- Normalized DL MAC Cell Throughput considering actual PDSCH slot only\n- Average DL MAC DRB Throughput\n- DL MAC DRB Throughput per QoS\n- Mean Downlink Throughput\n\nOperation\n\nThis feature is OFF by default. This feature introduces the attribute\n\nSectorCarrier.evmPowerBackoffAllowed and can be enabled by\n\nsetting it to ON.\n\nFor cases of radio mixed mode on the same PA, the backoff value might be insufficient\n\nfor radio and excessive for some users due to absence of coordination between\n\nschedulers. Therefore, it is recommended to keep this feature enhancement off if the\n\ntraffic load is always low even if the full transmitted power is used.

With the new attributes, random access range\n\ncan be configured more accurately.\n\nThis feature has the following benefits:\n\n- The configuration of the random access procedure is improved.\n- The benefits of this feature are most prominent if the random access range is configured to be much smaller than the cell range.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nIf the random access range is configured to be much smaller than the cell range, the\n\nprobability of accepting UEs within the cell range but outside of the random access\n\nrange is reduced. In setups with large cell ranges, this configuration improves the\n\naccuracy of UEs accepted in the cell.\n\nIf the random access range is configured to be smaller than the cell range, UEs in\n\nthe area within the cell range but outside of the configured random access range are\n\nunable to request initial access to the cell. If there are many UEs in this area,\n\nthe Random Access MSG1 Success Rate KPI decreases.\n\nOperation\n\nTo enable this feature, the EUtranCellFDD.raRange attribute or the\n\nEUtranCellTDD.raRange attribute must be set to a value larger\n\nthan 0. If the value of these attributes is 0,\n\nthis feature is disabled. If the feature is disabled, these attributes are ignored\n\nby the cell, and the random access range is defined instead by the cell range.\n\nTable 3   Attributes\n\n| Attribute                                                | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| EUtranCellFDD.raRange  EUtranCellTDD.raRange             | Introduced | See MOM description.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| EUtranCellFDD.raObsMaxRange  EUtranCellTDD.raObsMaxRange | Introduced | See MOM description.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| EUtranCellFDD.cellRange  EUtranCellTDD.cellRange         | Affected   | With this feature, the cell range must be set to a value larger                                     than or equal to the random access range.

Sometimes, it leads to a shortage of\n\nan internal RAN Compute unit storage. From 23.Q1 radio software is no longer stored\n\non the RAN Compute unit disk, resulting in a significant increase of the amount of\n\navailable disk space. It will benefit upgrades with 23.Q1 as a from-state, and all\n\nfuture upgrades. Please observe that Baseband R503 software and Radio Gateway\n\nsoftware are in this context treated as radio software.\n\nBefore 23.Q1, the radio software was permanently stored on the RAN Compute unit disk,\n\nwhile from 23.Q1 onwards, the radio software is deleted after the radio units have\n\nbeen successfully loaded and started. The radio software is also deleted from older\n\nUpgrade Packages (UPs), that are stored on the RAN Compute unit disk. If a radio\n\nsoftware is needed again, it is automatically redownloaded from SMRS. Downloading a\n\nradio software from SMRS can take from a few seconds up to a few minutes, depending\n\non dimensioning of the O&amp;M link.\n\nRadio units have own persistent storage for software, where they store the software\n\ncurrently running, and a previous one. Therefore, it is only in rare cases that a\n\nradio requires software from a RAN Compute unit again. Examples of such cases are: a\n\nradio unit replacement, or a rollback to a second older UP.\n\nAlthough this is not a new requirement, it is important to remember that all RAN\n\nCompute units must have access to an SMRS server where UPs are located. It is also\n\nimportant to make sure that the SMRS server stores all the UPs that are used by the\n\nRAN Compute units in the network, either currently or as a backup.\n\nENM 21.4 introduced a feature for locking UPs at SMRS to prevent accidental removal,\n\nthat can be of additional help. In case a radio software is needed, but the related\n\nUP is not be found on SMRS, the alarm Software Management Lost\n\nConnection to File Server with slogan AT:On file\n\nserver, number of LMC files not found is raised.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nNo impact.\n\nOperation\n\nNo impact.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nHardware\n\nNo special hardware requirements.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.\n\n2.2.1923.Q1: Radio Software Temporarily Stored on RAN Compute Unit\n\n### 2.2.20 23.Q1: Radio Deep Sleep Mode Enhancement\n\nThis feature enhancement adds energy metering and improves stability for the Radio\n\nDeep Sleep Mode feature on AAS radios.\n\n| Feature                                 Name           | Radio Deep Sleep Mode   | Radio Deep Sleep Mode   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Feature                                 Identity       | FAJ 121 5404            | FAJ 121 5404            |\n| Value Package                                 Name     | LTE Base Package        | NR Base Package         |\n| Value Package                                 Identity | FAJ 801 0400            | FAJ 801 4002            |\n| Node                                 Type              | Baseband Radio Node     | Baseband Radio Node     |\n| Access                                 Type            | LTE                     | NR                      |\n| Impact at                                 Upgrade      | Mandatory               | Mandatory               |\n\nSummary and Benefits\n\nThe feature\n\nenhancement\n\nsynchronizes the carrier release and the Radio Deep Sleep Mode feature in\n\nAAS radios.

The Normal priority file\n\nsize maximum is increased from 30MB to 100MB.\n\nRAM disk size for low capacity hardware is scaled in line with node capacity, thereby\n\nenabling more memory for traffic related functionality.

Instead of a single attribute to control the maximum file size for the CCTR, High Priority and Normal Priority files the file sizes are configured independently using attributes under PmEventM:EventProducer=Lrat:FileTypes=1:FileType. The existing setting is not preserved at upgrade. Instead, the default setting is set to be the maximum file size that was supported by the old attribute (30MB for a 270 MB RAM disk), minimizing customer impact at upgrade. Overall file storage is still protected by the disk monitor.\n\nNR Configuration Management Impacts:\n\n- CCTR, Normal Priority and High Priority file size maximums are no longer hardcoded at 30MB and they are now configurable to 30MB, 100MB and 30MB respectively (for a 270 MB RAM disk). The default value is 30MB.\n\nInterfaces\n\nThis feature does not impact signaling interfaces.\n\nHardware\n\nThere are no hardware limitations on supported Baseband units.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nThe OAM interface and its overall bandwidth requirements are impacted. Larger files\n\nmean that ENM needs to collect, process and store more data per ROP. The feature is\n\nplanned for delivery without any dependency on ENM.

environments, the following benefits might be observed\n\nby tuning the EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr or the\n\nEUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attribute to a lower\n\nvalue:\n\n- Improved robustness\n- Improved cell and UE throughput in the uplink\n- Improved UL Scheduled Entities per TTI\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThe performance of this feature enhancement can be observed with the following\n\ncounters monitoring the total UE scheduling activity in Uplink Coordinated\n\nMulti-Point Reception:\n\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmSchedActivityUeUl\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmSchedActivityUeUl\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmSchedActivityUeUlComp\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmSchedActivityUeUlComp\n\nRobustness is improved in high uplink traffic load cells.\n\nThis feature enhancement decreases the following PM

following PM counters:\n\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmSchedActivityUeUlComp\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmSchedActivityUeUlComp\n\nThe recommended value of the EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr or\n\nthe EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attribute is\n\n400. In high uplink traffic load cells, the\n\nEUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr or the\n\nEUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attribute can be set to a\n\nsmaller value to rule out more users from Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception.\n\nA smaller value might have a negative impact on the following KPIs:\n\n- Average UL MAC Cell Throughput\n- UL HARQ BLER\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nHardware\n\nNo specific hardware requirements.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nIt is recommended to use ENM version 23.3 or later to support the\n\nMOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement.

The specific proportion of Uplink CoMP users is difficult to predict, since it is related to the distribution of users and the user traffic model in network.\n\nIn other cases,\n\nthe\n\nUplink throughput and PUSCH receiver processing load decreases,\n\nwhile the robustness of the node increases.\n\nOperation\n\nThe default values of the EUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr\n\nattribute and the EUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attribute\n\nare changed from 150 to 400. As a result, more UEs\n\nare selected as Uplink Coordinated Multi-Point Reception users, Uplink throughput\n\nmight degrade in high Uplink load\n\nscenario.\n\nIn high Uplink traffic load cases, it is recommended to set the\n\nEUtranCellFDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr or\n\nEUtranCellTDD.ulCompUserSelSinrThr attribute to a value\n\nsmaller\n\nthan 400 to improve\n\nthe\n\nrobustness. Decreasing the value of these attributes might\n\nincrease Uplink throughput, but the exact value depends on the site settings.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nHardware\n\nFor this feature enhancement, Uplink CoMP-capable hardware is needed.\n\nThis feature enhancement\n\nis\n\napplicable to\n\nLTE\n\nFDD and LTE TDD hardware.

The filtering is based on the MORAN on single Baseband operator core network from which the S1AP KILL REQUEST message with the CMAS notification is received.\n\nThe benefit of this feature enhancement is that the updated Public Warning System\n\nfeature processes enable support for the MORAN on single Baseband Shared LTE RAN\n\nconfiguration.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThe PWS functionality can

This results in the following changes:\n\n- The number of LTE-to-NR Standalone relations increases.Note: This is only applicable if the first PLMN does not support mobility and at least one additional PLMN does.\n- The number of successful NR IRAT handover attempts increases.\n\nThe introduced eNodeB MOM structure allows the creation of new LTE-to-NR Standalone\n\nrelations and handover to the additional PLMNs of the shared NR cell. The feature\n\nenhancement can be observed with the following existing PM\n\ncounters:\n\n- GUtranCellRelation.pmHoExeAtt\n- GUtranCellRelation.pmHoExeSucc\n- GUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepAtt\n- GUtranCellRelation.pmHoPrepSucc\n\nThe\n\nbehavior of the feature enhancement can be observed with the following\n\nevents:\n\n- INTERNAL\\_PROC\\_HO\\_EXEC\\_S1\\_OUT\n- INTERNAL\\_PROC\\_HO\\_PREP\\_S1\\_OUT\n- INTERNAL\\_EVENT\\_NEIGHBGNB\\_CHANGE\n\nOperation\n\nThe NR Coverage-Triggered NR Session Continuity feature must be activated for the\n\nfeature enhancement to operate. This is a prerequisite for creating Automated\n\nNeighbor Relations for LTE-to-NR Standalone neighbor cell relations.\n\nThe legacy feature enhancement for the automatic creation of LTE-to-NR Standalone\n\nrelations is a prerequisite for this feature enhancement to operate.\n\nThe feature enhancement is applicable for new LTE-to-NR Standalone relations.\n\nExisting LTE-to-NR Standalone relations are automatically updated after activating\n\nthe feature enhancement. The update is requested by the UE and is based on the B1 NR\n\nStandalone measurement.\n\nThe feature enhancement introduces the\n\nGutranCellRelation.mobilityStatusNR attribute, which is\n\nautomatically created based on the NR TAC value and shows the mobility status\n\ninformation of the neighbor NR cell.\n\nThe feature enhancement introduces the\n\nExternalGUtranCell.ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO class for the\n\nneighbor NR cell shared by multiple operators. The attributes in this MO\n\nclass                 contain the NR TAC and the associated PLMN information. The\n\nExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO class and the attributes under\n\nit are created and deleted automatically by the Automated Neighbor Relations\n\nfeature. The following attributes in the\n\nExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO class are also introduced:\n\n- ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.createdBy\n- ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.externalBroadcastPLMNInfoId\n- ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.pLMNIdList\n- ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.nRTAC\n\nIf the ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.pLMNIdList and the\n\nExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.nRTAC attributes are manually\n\nconfigured by the operator, the Automated Neighbor Relations feature does not\n\noverwrite them automatically. If the configuration of the\n\nExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.pLMNIdList and the\n\nExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.nRTAC attributes change on the\n\ngNodeB side after activating the feature enhancement, the eNodeB MOM structure can\n\nonly be updated manually.\n\nA maximum of 12 ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO instances can exist\n\nat the same time in each ExternalGUtranCell MO instance. A\n\nmaximum of 12 unique PLMN IDs are supported across the\n\nExternalGUtranCell MO instance, including all\n\nExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO instances.\n\nThe handover evaluation process of the Outgoing NR IRAT Handover feature is updated.\n\nIf at least one ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO instance exists, the\n\nhandover evaluation process checks all available information about the NR TAC and\n\nthe associated PLMNs only in the attributes that belong to the\n\nExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO instances. If there are no\n\nExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo MO instances, then the handover\n\nevaluation process checks the ExternalGUtranCell MO instance.\n\nIf the first PLMN does not support mobility and at least one additional PLMN does, a\n\nnew LTE-to-NR Standalone relation is created. The following conditions must be true\n\nto create the relation:\n\n- The value of the associated ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.nRTAC attribute of the first PLMN in the NCGI report is -1 or 0.\n- The value of the associated ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.nRTAC attribute of at least one additional PLMN of the shared NR cell is higher than 0.\n\nEach PLMN across the ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.pLMNIdList attribute\n\nmust have a unique ExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.nRTAC attribute\n\nvalue, except when the value of the\n\nExternalBroadcastPLMNInfo.nRTAC attribute is empty.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nHardware\n\nNo specific hardware requirements.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nThe UE must be capable of LTE-to-NR Standalone and support the\n\nreportCGI-NR-EN-DC-r15 and the\n\nreportCGI-NR-NoEN-DC-r15 UE capabilities.\n\nIt is required to use ENM version 23.03 or later to\n\nsupport the MOM changes introduced by this feature enhancement.\n\nWithout ENM, parameters can only be configured through\n\nMOShell.\n\nRelated Information\n\nAutomated Neighbor Relations\n\nOutgoing NR IRAT Handover\n\nShared NR RAN\n\n2.3.823.Q1: External Broadcast PLMN Support by Automated Neighbor Relations for LTE to NR SA Mobility\n\n### 2.3.9 23.Q1: Support for up to Nine Cells with Downlink MU-MIMO and SRS Capability\n\nEnabling uplink SRS when there are many connected UEs might affect the KPIs of\n\nneighbor cells.\n\n| Feature Name           | Basic AAS for TDD                                                                  |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 4882                                                                       |\n| Value Package Name     | Basic                                 Massive                                 MIMO |\n| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 1010                                                                       |\n| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node                                                                |\n| Access Type            | LTE                                                                                |\n| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                                                                           |\n\nSummary and Benefits\n\nEnabling uplink SRS when there are many connected UEs might affect the KPIs of\n\nneighbor cells.\n\nCapacity\n\nand Performance\n\nWhen uplink SRS is enabled, connected UEs send SRS with full band to the eNodeB on\n\nspecial subframes 1 and 6, even if there is no uplink traffic.

If the candidate cell valid for inter-cell UE\n\npreemption is selected from the list of cells reported as candidates, UE preemption\n\nis started in that cell. If inter-cell UE preemption is unsuccessful, there are no\n\nfurther UE preemption attempts.\n\nAdditional UE preemption is started in the selected cell from the list of cells\n\nreported as candidates for inter-cell UE preemption. If UE preemption fails in the\n\nselected cell, no further UE preemption attempts are performed in other candidate\n\ncells.\n\nThe benefit of the feature enhancement is that there is a higher chance for HPA and\n\nemergency call users to be admitted into a cell during UE congestion on the eNodeB\n\nor the Baseband level.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThe feature enhancement does not impact cell UE capacity.\n\nThe Accessibility and Mobility main KPIs increase for HPA\n\nand emergency call users compared to non-privileged access users. The\n\nRetainability main KPI decreases for non-privileged access users\n\ncompared to HPA and emergency call users. These KPI changes are observable only when\n\nthere is UE congestion on the Baseband or the eNodeB level.\n\nThe following\n\nexisting\n\nPM counters can be used to observe the number of RRC Connection Request attempts and\n\ntheir success rate for HPA UEs:\n\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabAttHpa\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnEstabAttHpa\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmRrcConnEstabSuccHpa\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmRrcConnEstabSuccHpa\n\nOperation\n\nThe following attributes are introduced for the configuration of the feature\n\nenhancement:\n\n- AdmissionControl.recalcPreemptableUeTimer\n- EUtranCellFDD.peUeToInterCellPreHyst\n- EUtranCellTDD.peUeToInterCellPreHyst\n- EUtranCellFDD.peUeToInterCellPreThrUnreg\n- EUtranCellTDD.peUeToInterCellPreThrUnreg\n\nThe following attributes are introduced for the configuration of the PA reservation\n\npool:\n\n- EUtranCellFDD.paConnCellUeReservations\n- EUtranCellTDD.paConnCellUeReservations\n\nThe following attributes are deprecated:\n\n- EUtranCellFDD.zzzTemporary78\n- EUtranCellTDD.zzzTemporary78\n\nThe following PM counters are introduced to observe the number of inter-cell UE\n\npreemption attempts:\n\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmUePeAttInterCell\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmUePeAttInterCell\n\nThe following PM counters are introduced to observe the number of successful UE\n\ncontext releases caused by inter-cell UE preemption:\n\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmUeCtxtRelAbnormalEnbPeInterCell\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmUeCtxtRelAbnormalEnbPeInterCell\n\nThe feature enhancement updates the EVENT\\_PARAM\\_UE\\_PREEMPTION\\_CAUSE PM\n\nevent parameter with the following values:\n\n- EVENT\\_VALUE\\_INTER\\_CELL\\_UE\\_PREEMPTION\n- EVENT\\_VALUE\\_PREEMPTION\\_CELL\\_THRESHOLD\\_EXCEEDED\n\nThe activation of the Differentiated Admission Control feature is a prerequisite for\n\nthis feature enhancement.

This is possible only if the UE is in the coverage of the NR cell in idle\n\nmode and the SIB24 is broadcast.\n\nThis feature enhancement has the following benefits\n\nfor\n\nNR standalone-capable UEs in NR coverage in idle mode:\n\n- NR-standalone capable UEs can be steered in idle mode to be provided with NR coverage in connected mode.\n- The duration of NR service delays is reduced.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThe Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control and the TM9 Capability-Aware Idle Mode Control\n\nfeatures allow the inclusion of the selected NR frequencies based on the cell\n\nreselection priorities and subpriorities of the\n\nGUtranFreqRelation MO in the IMMCI.\n\nWhen\n\nthe IMMCI is signaled to NR standalone-capable UEs for idle mode mobility control,\n\nthe number of RRC connections to the LTE cell are reduced. Because of this, the NR\n\nstandalone-capable UEs are steered to the NR cell.\n\nOperation\n\nThe feature enhancement is enabled by setting the\n\nUePolicyOptimization.zzzTemporary1 attribute to\n\n2. This affects NR standalone-capable UEs during connection\n\nrelease if the UE qualifies to be released with prioritized EN-DC or TM9-capable\n\nfrequencies. If this configuration is used, the frequency selection process is\n\nperformed according to the following steps:\n\n1. EN-DC or TM9-capable frequencies are prioritized.\n2. NR frequencies for which the value of the GUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionPriority attribute is equal to or greater than 0 are selected.\n3. NR frequencies with the value of 0 in the GUtranFreqRelation.cellReselectionSubPriority attribute are disregarded.\n4.

Activating PIM\n\ncancellation requires one HWAC license for each radio and each node. PIM sources\n\nconsidered are non-linear or stable. Non-linear PIM sources have the following\n\ncharacteristics:\n\n- No saturation of third-order and fifth-order inter modulation products\n- Third-order inter modulation is stronger than fifth-order\n\nThe characteristics of stable PIM sources vary because of temperature and aging.\n\nThis system improvement provides the following benefits:\n\n- Mitigation of the sensitivity degradation caused by PIM. Receiver sensitivity is impacted if PIM overlaps receiver signals in the spectrum. With PIM cancellation, the overlapping PIM is suppressed, which improves the receiver sensitivity.\n- Improved uplink KPIs for NR and LTE FDD radio units\n- Improved uplink throughput\n- Fewer site visits for PIM source cleaning\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nPIM cancellation protects uplink signals by suppressing third- and fifth-order\n\nin-line PIM that is generated by downlink signals.\n\nOperation\n\nThe following attributes are used for PIM cancellation configuration:\n\n- PimcHwacControl.pimcEnabled\n- PimcHwacControl.pimcHwacAllocated\n\nThe radio unit must be locked before the PIM cancellation configuration is changed\n\nand then unlocked.\n\nThe PIM cancellation performance can be observed through the following PM\n\ncounters:\n\n- RfPort.pmPimcCancellationDepth\n- RfPort.pmPimcPowerSignalInjected\n\nDuring the configuration of PIM\n\ncancellation,\n\nthe following alarms can be raised:\n\n- The MO Configuration Exceeds Resources Enabled by the Key alarm indicates the shortage of PIM cancellation HWAC licenses. PIM cancellation configuration requires one HWAC license for each radio and each node.\n- The MO Configuration Not Consistent With Installed Equipment alarm indicates that the radio is not supported for PIM cancellation.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nHardware\n\nThe system improvement is supported on the following hardware units:\n\n- Radio 2262\n- Radio 4490\n- Radio 4490HP 44B1 44B3 C\n- RAN Compute Groups 3-5\n\nFor more information on specific RAN Compute units, see DU and Baseband\n\nConfigurations and Capacity in the Radio Node Configurations library.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nIt is required to use ENM version 21.1 or later to support the MOM changes introduced\n\nby this system improvement.\n\n2.3.3123.Q2: PIM Cancellation in Radio Units\n\n### 2.3.32 23.Q2: Outgoing NR IRAT Handover from EN-DC to NR Standalone\n\nThis feature enhancement enables the handover of EN-DC connected UEs to a standalone\n\nNR network through the N26 interface when the UE measures good coverage in an NR\n\nfrequency.\n\n| Feature Name           | Outgoing NR IRAT Handover   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Feature Identity       | FAJ 121 5377                |\n| Value Package Name     | Basic NR Mobility Support   |\n| Value Package Identity | FAJ 801 1018                |\n| Node Type              | Baseband Radio Node         |\n| Access Type            | LTE                         |\n| Impact at Upgrade      | Optional                    |\n\nSummary and Benefits\n\nThe enhancement allows UEs with EN-DC connection to be handed over to NR standalone\n\nnetworks.

One primary node can control the support system units in                                     several cabinets. |\n\n# 3 Feature Operation of Multicabinet Control\n\nThe feature is used to expand existing, installed sites.\n\nThe feature allows a Radio Node to share radio units with another node in a multicabinet\n\nconfiguration. The DU or Baseband unit is connected to the Baseband R503 in the other cabinet\n\nthrough optical CPRI links. This results in the increased use of radio units without\n\nrelocation of radio resources. Up to seven cabinets can be used in a multicabinet\n\nconfiguration.\n\nFigure 1   Example of RBS Configurations over Two RBS Cabinets (Baseband Unit with EC Bus\n\nPort)\n\nFigure 2   Example of RBS Configurations over Two RBS Cabinets (Baseband Unit without EC Bus\n\nPort)\n\nThe communication to the second cabinet can only be established by connecting the CPRI link\n\nto either of the following units:\n\n- A primary role DU or Baseband unit\n- A secondary role DU or Baseband unit\n\nWhen the CPRI link connection is lost, the support system cannot switch to any other\n\navailable CPRI link towards Baseband R503.\n\nThere can be one or more primary role nodes in a multicabinet configuration as each cabinet\n\ncan have a separate primary role node. Each primary role node controls its own support system.\n\nOne primary role node can control the support system units in several cabinets. One secondary\n\nrole node can be connected to up to seven primary role nodes.\n\nFor more information about this configuration, see Radio\n\nDot System.\n\n## 3.1 Network Management\n\nRadio access systems are configured separately, but some coordination is\n\nneeded.\n\nEach installed radio access system is managed separately from the OSS. The standards are seen\n\nas separate nodes and are configured separately. For more information, see\n\nMixed Mode All-In-One User\n\nGuide.\n\nThe radio access systems are seen as separate nodes and are configured separately. For nodes\n\nin the same cabinet the Cabinet.sharedCabinetIdentifier attribute must be\n\nset to the same value.\n\n## 3.2 Radio Configurations\n\nEach node in a multicabinet configuration has a separate radio configuration, even if\n\nthere are shared radio units.\n\nMixed Mode sectors are configured in both nodes by selecting a RBB which supports shared\n\nradio units. For more information about radio configurations, see\n\nMixed Mode All-In-One User\n\nGuide\n\nand Radio Node Configurations.\n\n## 3.3 Support System and Control\n\nMulticabinet configurations have at least one node acting as primary system\n\nsupport.\n\nIf two or more nodes are installed in the same multicabinet cluster, at least one of them\n\ntakes the primary support system role. It is not obligatory to have more than one node with a\n\nprimary support system role. There can be multiple nodes with a primary support system role,\n\nso power and climate control are decentralized to multiple cabinets.\n\nA node can have multiple roles. A node can take both a primary support system role and a\n\nsecondary support system role. If a node takes multiple roles, the roles must be reversed.\n\nOnce the roles are established, they must stay the same.\n\nThe feature demands that a node with primary support system role can establish a connection\n\nto all cabinets, which means connection to support system units. It can go through any of the\n\nfollowing connections:\n\n- Units that provide EC bus connectivity, for example a Baseband R503 or an IRU\n- Stretching a physical EC bus between cabinets\n\nAn example of such configurations is connectivity between an RBS and power cabinets. For\n\ninformation about how to connect an enclosure and power cabinets, see Non-RF Connections.\n\nThe following limitations apply for WCDMA nodes if using a Baseband R503:\n\n- A GSM DU Radio node in a multicabinet cluster can only be configured as a node with a secondary support system role.\n- GSM nodes can only take a secondary support system role towards one node with a primary support system role.\n- GSM nodes cannot take multiple roles.\n\nThe functions are available for WCDMA nodes using an IRU.\n\nFor more information about nodes with primary and secondary support system roles, see\n\nManage Hardware Equipment.\n\n## 3.4 Cabling\n\nThe third splitter port on Baseband R503 cannot be used for multicabinet\n\ncommunication.\n\nFor more information on cabling and connections, see Antenna and RF Connections and Non-RF\n\nConnections.\n\n## 3.5 Power Distribution Setting\n\nUnits must be secured to remain operational during battery backup.\n\nUnits must be secured to remain operational when the voltage level Main\n\nload disconnect is reached during battery backup. In AC-powered\n\ncabinets, the following units must be set as priority load to secure them:\n\n- Baseband units\n- DU\n- SCU\n- Interconnection units that provide EC bus connection, for example Baseband R503 or IRU.\n\nFor more information about PCR setting, see PDU Description.\n\n## 3.6 Radio Fault Handling\n\nWhen an error occurs in a radio unit, it sends fault indications to all connected radio\n\nunits.\n\nFor more information about radio fault handling, see\n\nMixed Mode All-In-One User\n\nGuide.\n\n## 3.7 Synchronization\n\nFor RBS nodes with sectors running in Mixed Mode, the system clock in the LTE node must\n\nbe synchronized with the system clock in the node sharing its radio units.\n\nFor ways to synchronize the LTE node system clock with the system clock in the node sharing\n\nits radio units, and for the related parameters, see Manage Node Group Synchronization.\n\n# 4 Network Impact of Multicabinet Control\n\nThe implementation of this feature has no impact on the network.\n\n# 5 Parameters for Multicabinet Control\n\nThis feature introduces parameters that are used to configure the cabinet.\n\nParameters\n\nTable 3   Parameters\n\n| Parameter                                | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Climate.climateControlMode               | Introduced | See MOM description.

Information about multicabinet control visibility from OSS can be found\n\nin the applicable OSS CPI.\n\nFor more information, see\n\nMixed Mode All-In-One User\n\nGuide.\n\nRelated reference\n\nParameters for Multicabinet Control\n\n## 9.3 Alarm Configuration and Reporting\n\nMost multicabinet configuration alarms are reported by and are controlled from the\n\nprimary node.\n\nIn a multicabinet configuration, the primary node reports all alarms related to the support\n\nsystem, except the Inconsistent Configuration alarm which is raised on the secondary role\n\nnode. All alarms that are raised are visible for each cabinet and can be handled in multiple\n\ninstances for the cluster, depending on the object.\n\nExternal alarm ports are available in the cabinet where the primary role node is located and\n\nthey are only possible to administrate, control and configure from there. The secondary role\n\nnode can mirror alarm changes on the AlarmPort MOs in the primary role node\n\nit is connected to. For more information, see Manage Hardware Equipment.\n\n# Appendix A: Feature Change History\n\nThis section lists changes that affected this feature and the impact it had on the\n\nnetwork.\n\n## Appendix A.a: 17.Q2: Multicabinet Control: Support for Seven Cabinets\n\nThe Multicabinet Control feature enhancement supports multistandard configurations with\n\nRBS cabinets. The enhancement also enables fault handling.\n\n| Feature Name:           | Multicabinet Control   |\n|-------------------------|------------------------|\n| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3095 R3        |\n| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package       |\n| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400 R7        |\n| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node    |\n| Access Type:            | LTE, WCDMA, GSM        |\n\nThis feature supports multistandard configurations spanning over multiple RBS cabinets, for\n\ninstance when deploying LTE Inter-Band Carrier Aggregation, where the radio units of the\n\ndifferent frequency bands are distributed over multiple macro RBS cabinets.\n\nThe maximum number of supported cabinets is seven, regardless of cabinet type.\n\nThe enhancement also introduces fault handling: it is possible to detect an incorrect\n\nconfiguration where several nodes are configured as the primary node.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nNo impact.\n\nOperation\n\nNo impact.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nHardware\n\nNo special hardware requirements.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.\n\n## Appendix A.b: 17.Q4: Multi Cabinet Solution, Support for Multiple Roles\n\nThe enhancement introduces the possibility for nodes to have multiple support system roles in a multi cabinet cluster.\n\n| Feature Name:           | Multi Cabinet Control              |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3095 R4                    |\n| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                   |\n| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400 R9                    |\n| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |\n| Access Type:            | LTE, WCDMA, GSM                    |\n\nThe enhancement introduces the possibility for nodes to have multiple support system roles in a\n\nmulti cabinet cluster. A node can have a primary role and a secondary role, and act as a\n\nprimary role node and secondary role node at the same time. However, there can only be\n\none primary role node in each multi cabinet cluster. The introduction of multiple role\n\nnodes enables the creation of large multi cabinet solutions, and the expansion or\n\nrebuilding of sites by using existing equipment in a flexible way.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nNo impact.\n\nOperation\n\nThe enhancement introduces a second instance of MO\n\nEquipmentSupportFunction to be able to support a multiple\n\nrole node. If the node is a multiple role node, the roles indicated by the\n\nsupportSystemControl attribute on the\n\nEquipmentSupportFunction MO instances have to be\n\ndifferent.\n\nThe following new attributes are introduced, as well:\n\n- Attribute equipmentSupportFunctionRef in MO EcBus\n- Attribute equipmentSupportFunctionRef in MO ExternalNode\n- Attribute reservedBy in MO EquipmentSupportFunction\n\nNew additional text is added to the Inconsistent\n\nConfiguration alarm, due to the second instance of the\n\nEquipmentSupportFunction MO.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nHardware\n\nNo special hardware requirements.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nSupport for the new MO instance and attributes introduced by this enhancement.\n\nThe required support is automatically implemented, no operator action is needed.\n\n## Appendix A.c: 17.Q4: Multicabinet: Several Primary Role Nodes\n\nThe enhancement allows a more flexible way of building a multicabinet configuration and the operator can easily expand the configuration without expanding the footprint.\n\n| Feature Name:           | Multi Cabinet Control              |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3095 R4                    |\n| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                   |\n| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 801 0400 R9                    |\n| Node Type:              | Baseband Radio Node, DU Radio Node |\n| Access Type:            | LTE, WCDMA, GSM                    |\n\nThe enhancement allows the configuration of up to seven primary role nodes connected to a\n\nsecondary role node in a multicabinet configuration where each primary role node\n\ncontrols its own support system and the secondary role node is either an LTE DU Radio\n\nNode or a Baseband Radio Node. This allows a more flexible way of building a\n\nmulticabinet configuration and the operator can easily expand the configuration without\n\nexpanding the footprint. The enhancement also improves redundancy and fault behavior as\n\nclimate control is handled locally by a primary role node.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nNo impact.\n\nOperation\n\nClimate Inconsistent Configuration alarm is introduced on MO\n\nEquipmentSupportfinction with a new additional text. For more\n\ninformation see Climate Inconsistent Configuration.\n\nA child EcPort MO can be created under the AuxPlugInUnit\n\nMO, where this configuration represents a Baseband R unit in a secondary role node\n\nterminated to the hub of a primary role node allowing communication from the\n\nsecondary role node to a primary role node.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nHardware\n\nNo special hardware requirements.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nTo fully benefit from the change, the node required support from the following network\n\nelements:\n\n- Equipment Configuration Tool Update to an Equipment Configuration Tool version that supports configuration of one secondary role node connected to multiple primary role nodes.\n\n## Appendix A.d: 18.Q3: Multicabinet Control: Improved Connectivity\n\nThis improvement enables two MEs to share a remote cabinet.\n\n| Feature Name:           | Multicabinet Control               |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Feature Identity:       | FAJ 121 3095 R5                    |\n| Value Package Name:     | LTE Base Package                   |\n| Value Package Identity: | FAJ 121 4629 R12                   |\n| Node Type:              | DU Radio Node, Baseband Radio Node |\n| Access Type:            | LTE, WCDMA                         |\n\nDigital Unit and Baseband Unit are not mandatory in the shared cabinet.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nNo impact.\n\nOperation\n\nA new ExternalNode.inciConnectorRef attribute is introduced to refer to a\n\nshared unit (FieldReplaceableUnit or\n\nAuxPlugInUnit MO) that can provide inter-node connectivity\n\nbetween two MEs. The CPRI link connected to the shared unit is used by both the\n\nprimary and secondary MEs. This attribute is mandatory to configure on both\n\nsides.\n\nInterfaces\n\nNo impact.\n\nHardware\n\nDU and Baseband units with CPRI and EC-port capability.\n\nOther Network Elements\n\nNo impact.",

It also introduces the possibility to map the following five\n\ndifferent traffic classes to any of the priority levels:\n\n- Mobile Originating Data\n- Mobile Originating Signaling\n- CSFB\n- MMTEL Voice\n- MMTEL Video\n\nThe Load-Based Access Barring and Progressive Access Barring features only provide\n\nmanual configuration for Special Access Classes ranging from Access Class 10 to\n\n15.\n\nThe Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes feature introduces the following\n\nfunctions:\n\n- Possibility to define the priority of individual Special Access Classes\n- Possibility to automatically decide to bar individual Special Access Classes depending on the defined priority\n- Possibility to extend priority level 3 and 4 for finer prioritization Note: Additional priorities can be used for the Progressive Access Barring feature without license of this feature.\n\nAccess barring prioritization of Special Access Classes is useful to give precedence to\n\ncritical services like national security or public safety under an overload\n\nscenario.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nFor more information about this feature and related topics see, 3GPP TS 36.331\n\n- Radio Resource Control (RRC) Protocol Specification.\n\n# 2 Dependencies of Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes\n\nThis feature has prerequisite features related to access barring, conflicts with\n\nother features in connection with inter-frequency measurements, and it is related to other\n\nfeatures regarding access barring and overload control.\n\nTable 1   Feature Dependencies\n\n| Feature                                                                       | Relationship   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Load-Based Access Barring                                 (FAJ 121 3093)      | Prerequisite   | The Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes feature requires                                 the Load-Based Access Barring feature to be activated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Progressive Access Barring                                 (FAJ 121 4746)     | Prerequisite   | The Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes feature requires                                 the Progressive Access Barring feature to be activated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Inter-Frequency Offload (FAJ 121                                 3061)        | Conflicting    | Subscription ratio measurements are disabled when automatic access class barring is             triggered.

The barring of standard access classes is interpreted as a barring factor\n\nwhich can be translated into barring probability. The special access classes have\n\nbarring information, which indicates only a barred or not barred state, based on the\n\ncurrent barring factor and priority level.\n\nThe barring information of the special access class is set to BARRED\n\nif any of the following cases occur:\n\n- The priority level of the special access class is lower than the current priority level\n- The priority level of the special access class is equal to the current priority level and the barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the priority level\n\nBoth standard access classes barring and special access classes barring have a\n\ndependency within the same traffic class. The UE monitors barring information of\n\nspecial access classes only when barring factor of standard access classes is set to\n\n0. For more information, see 3GPP TS 36.331, Evolved\n\nUniversal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Radio Resource Control (RRC);\n\nProtocol specification.\n\nIf the barring state of any special access class is set to BARRED,\n\nthe barring factor of the standard access class belonging to the corresponding\n\ntraffic class is automatically set to 0 regardless of the\n\nconfigured minimum barring factor. Because of this dependency, the priority level of\n\nspecial access classes needs to be set to higher than or equal to the priority level\n\nof standard access classes within the same traffic class.\n\nDuring an ongoing automatic access class barring calculation mechanism, the handover\n\nfor inter-frequency load balancing and inter-frequency offload will be\n\nrestricted.\n\nTo activate automatic access barring of special access classes, the following steps\n\nare required:\n\n1. Set the priority level of special access classes using the following members of the EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPresence and EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPresence structs:\n    - acBarringPrioMoDataSpecAc\n    - acBarringPrioMoSignalingSpecAc\n    - acBarringPrioCsfbSpecAc\n    - acBarringPrioMmtelVoiceSpecAc\n    - acBarringPrioMmtelVideoSpecAcs\n    - acBarringPrioEmergencySpecAc\n2. Set access barring mode of special access classes to AUTO.\n    - Access barring mode of special access classes of each traffic class, ranging from Special Access Class 11 to 15, follows the access barring mode of standard access classes. This is set by the following members of the EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPresence and EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPresence structs: acBarringForMoDataPresence acBarringForMoSignPresence acBarringForCsfbPresence acBarringForMmtelVoicePresence acBarringForMmtelVideoPresence\n    - Access barring mode of emergency Special Access Class 10 is set by the following members of the EUtranCellFDD.acBarringPresence and EUtranCellTDD.acBarringPresence structs: acBarringForEmergencySpecAcPres acBarringForEmergencySpecAcPres\n\nExample 2   Prioritization of Standard Access Classes and\n\nSpecial Access Classes\n\nFor an example on how to prioritize standard access\n\nclasses and special access classes using extended priority level, see Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2   Prioritization of Standard Access Classes and Special Access Classes\n\nExample 3   Setting Barring Information for Each Access\n\nClass\n\nFor an example on how to set barring information for each access\n\nclass, see Figure 3.\n\nThe following\n\nconditions are assumed in the provided example:\n\n- The current barring factor is 50.\n- The current priority level is 2.\n- The minimum barring factor for all priority levels is

This functionality\n\nprioritizes the PLMNs for access class barring in addition to prioritizing the traffic\n\nclasses.\n\nThe Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following\n\nlicensed features are activated:\n\n- Load-Based Access Barring\n- PLMN-Specific Access Barring\n- Progressive Access Barring\n\nThe functionality is enabled if attribute\n\nEUtranCellFDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled or\n\nEUtranCellTDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled is set to\n\ntrue.\n\nWhen this access class barring functionality is used, the following applies:\n\n- The common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority relations among traffic classes.\n- Access class barring starts at the lowest PLMN priority level for the traffic classes assigned to the lowest traffic priority level. If no PLMN is allocated to a PLMN priority level, the level is skipped.\n- The barring factors and the priority level are updated by applying the progressive access barring algorithms within each PLMN priority level. When the barring factor reaches the minimum barring factor for the highest traffic priority level on a PLMN priority level, access class barring is continued on the next higher PLMN priority level.\n\nIf the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, the following\n\napplies:\n\n- In the common access class barring parameters, barring factors are set the same value for the traffic class as the barring factors for the traffic class on the lowest PLMN priority level.\n- In the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, barring factors are updated for the traffic class.\n\n### 3.1.7 Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes\n\nProgressive Barring for Special Access Classes is an automatic access class barring\n\nfunctionality that extends the Progressive Access Barring feature. This functionality\n\nprioritizes the special access class in traffic classes in addition to prioritizing the\n\nstandard access classes.\n\nWith this functionality, the barring factors and the priority\n\nlevel are updated by applying the progressive barring for special access classes\n\nalgorithms. If the priority level of a special access class is equal to the current\n\npriority level and the barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the\n\npriority level, then the barring information of a special access class is set to\n\ntrue.\n\nIf the presence of a traffic class of a special access class in SIB2 is set to\n\nAUTO, the following applies:\n\n- In the common access class barring parameters, barring factors are updated for the traffic class.\n- In the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters, barring factors are not updated for the traffic class.\n\nBarring factors in PLMN-specific access class barring parameters are broadcast in\n\nSIB2 messages only if the presence of the traffic class in SIB2 is set to\n\nMANUAL.\n\n### 3.1.8 PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes\n\nPLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes is an automatic access\n\nclass         barring functionality that extends the Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes\n\nfeature. This functionality takes the PLMN-specific access barring configuration into\n\naccount when prioritizing the special access classes for access class barring.\n\nThe Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following\n\nlicensed features are activated:\n\n- Load-Based Access Barring\n- PLMN-Specific Access Barring\n- Progressive Access Barring\n- Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes\n\nWith this functionality, the barring factors and the priority\n\nlevel are updated by applying the progressive barring for special access classes\n\nalgorithms. If the priority level of a special access class is equal to the current\n\npriority level and the barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the\n\npriority level, then the barring information of a special access class is set to\n\ntrue.\n\nThe common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority\n\nrelations among standard and special access classes of traffic classes.\n\nThere is no priority relation between PLMNs.\n\nIf the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, barring\n\nfactors are updated for the special access class both in the common access class barring\n\nparameters and in the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters.\n\n### 3.1.9 Prioritized PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes\n\nPrioritized PLMN Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes is an automatic\n\naccess class barring functionality that extends the Progressive Barring for Special Access\n\nClasses feature. This functionality prioritizes the PLMNs for access class barring in\n\naddition to prioritizing the special access classes.\n\nThe Prioritized PLMN Progressive Access Barring functionality requires that the following\n\nlicensed features are activated:\n\n- Load-Based Access Barring\n- PLMN-Specific Access Barring\n- Progressive Access Barring\n- Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes\n\nThe functionality is enabled if attribute\n\nEUtranCellFDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled or\n\nEUtranCellTDD.acBarringPlmnPabEnabled is set to true.\n\nIf the PLMN priority is lower than the current PLMN priority, the barring information of\n\nthe special access class is set to barred.\n\nIf the PLMN priority is higher than the current PLMN priority, the barring information of\n\nthe special access class is set to not barred.\n\nIf the PLMN priority is equal to the current PLMN priority, the barring information of\n\nthe special access class is set as follows:\n\n- If the priority level of a special access class is lower than current priority level, the barring information of the special access class is set to barred.\n- If the priority level of a special access class is equal to current priority level and barring factor is equal to the minimum barring factor of the priority level, then barring information of the special access class is set to barred.\n- Otherwise, barring information of a special access class is set to not barred.\n\nThe common and the PLMN-specific access barring parameters share the same priority\n\nrelations among standard and special access classes of traffic classes.\n\nHence, the priority relations among standard and special access classes of traffic\n\nclasses are the same within each PLMN priority level. The priority relations among\n\nstandard and special access classes of traffic classes are defined by the Progressive\n\nBarring for Special Access Classes configuration.\n\nIf the presence of a traffic class in SIB2 is set to AUTO, barring\n\nfactors are updated for the special access class both in the common access class barring\n\nparameters and in the PLMN-specific access class barring parameters.\n\n# 4 Network Impact of Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes\n\nThe Progressive Barring for Special Access Classes feature has no network\n\nimpact.\n\nCapacity and

Performance Management ensures reliable and efficient use\n\nof the network through the following:\n\n- Monitoring\n- Identifying trends\n- Troubleshooting\n- Optimizing performance\n\n### 1.1.1 Network Aspects\n\nPerformance data gives information about the following aspects\n\nof the network:\n\n| Accessibility      |    | The ability of a service to be obtained when requested by the user within specified             tolerances and other given conditions     |\n|--------------------|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                    |    |                                                                                                                                           |\n| Retainability      |    | The ability of a service, once obtained, to continue to be provided under given             conditions for a requested duration           |\n|                    |    |                                                                                                                                           |\n| Integrity          |    | The degree to which a service, once obtained, is provided without excessive             impairments                                       |\n|                    |    |                                                                                                                                           |\n| System Utilization |    | Includes the following system aspects:  Hardware use     Licenses     Traffic and Load     Congestion     Transport Network     Admission |\n|                    |    |                                                                                                                                           |\n| Availability       |    | The resource availability                                                                                                                 |\n\n## 1.2 Performance Data Types\n\nPerformance data for a Baseband Radio Node consists of the following:\n\n- Performance statistics\n- Performance events\n\nFor troubleshooting, direct access to real-time performance statistics is supported.\n\nEvent Based Statistics for LTE (EBS-L) provides additional PM statistics produced from PM\n\nevents. For more information, see Event Based Statistics for LTE (EBS-L).\n\n## 1.3 Tools\n\nAn Operation and Support System (OSS) is used for the following:\n\n- Management of the performance data measurements\n- Analysis of the measurement results\n\nENIQ can be used for the following:\n\n- Additional measurements of performance data\n- Further processing of performance data\n- Analysis of performance data\n\nFor direct access to performance statistics, the following\n\ntools are used:\n\n- ECLI\n- EMCLI\n\n## 1.4 Performance Statistics\n\nPerformance statistics are collected from measurements on\n\nlive traffic in the radio and transport networks. Performance Statistics are a\n\nsubcategory of PM Counters.\n\nFor detailed information about each PM counter, valid for a\n\ngiven release, see the applicable MOM.\n\nA predefined set of performance statistics measurements is included at delivery, and\n\navailable immediately after the startup of the Network Element. The PM counter list\n\nshows which performance statistics measurements are predefined. The OSS automatically starts the predefined set of performance\n\nstatistics measurements.\n\nIn addition to the predefined performance statistics, the user defines which performance\n\nstatistics to measure. When the user-defined performance statistics and the measurement\n\nmethods are defined, the measurement must be activated to start measuring.\n\nRelated Information\n\nLists and Delta Lists\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nLicense and Resource Use Indicators\n\n### 1.4.1 Performance Statistics MOM\n\nIn MOM,\n\nthe performance statistics measurements are managed in the Pm MO\n\nclass.\n\nEach measurement is represented by an instance of the\n\nMeasurementType MO. The measurement types are grouped into PM\n\ngroups under the PmGroup MO instance.\n\nPM group names for flexible counters have\n\nthe\n\nprefix PmFlex to\n\nindicate\n\nthat the group contains flexible counters.\n\nEach PM group has a reference to one application MO class. Several PM groups may refer to\n\nthe same application MO class.\n\nStarting, modifying, and stopping a performance statistics measurement are done in the OSS through a PM job. In the MOM, a PM job is represented by an instance\n\nof the PmJob MO.\n\nMeasurement\n\nresults are reported in ROP files.\n\nThe\n\nnumber of ROP files per Result Out Period is controlled by the value of\n\nFileHandlingMethod in the\n\nPmSupport.ropFileHandling\n\nattribute. The\n\nPmSupport.ropFileHandling\n\nattribute is found under the NodeSupport MO. By\n\ndefault, the measurement results for all PM jobs are reported in one ROP file, and this\n\nvalue is set to SINGLE\\_ROP\\_FILE. If the value is set to\n\nMULTIPLE\\_ROP\\_FILES, the measurement results are reported in one ROP\n\nfile per defined PM job group. The PmJob.jobGroup attribute is used\n\nto define PM job groups.\n\nAfter a restart of the Network Element, the state of the PM\n\njobs is the same as before the restart.\n\n### 1.4.2 Performance Statistics ROP Files\n\nFor each performance statistics measurement, the result is presented in one or more\n\nstatistical files at the end of every Result Output Period (ROP). The ROP files are collected\n\nby the OSS for analysis. They are stored at the Network Element for 24\n\nhours, or until one of the following conditions is met:\n\n- The maximum number of files reaches the value defined in the PmMeasurementCapabilities.maxNoOfPmFiles attribute.\n\nThe supported Granularity Period and the ROP are 15\n\nminutes.\n\nThe performance statistics ROP files are in XML format and\n\ncompressed using GZIP. The ROP file format is defined by 3GPP in the following\n\nspecifications:\n\n- 3GPP TS 32.432 V10.0\n- 3GPP TS 32.435 V10.0\n\nBy default, the measurement results of all PM jobs are\n\nreported in one ROP file per ROP. However, the measurement results from groups of PM\n\njobs can be reported in one ROP file per PM job group. This is done by configuring\n\nmultiple ROP files. If multiple ROP files are configured, the ROP file names include the\n\nname of the PM job group in the UniqueId field of the file\n\nname. If the PM job group is not set for a PM job, then the PM job ends up in the\n\ndefault ROP file, without the PM job group in the name.\n\nIn the ROP file, the measurements are reported in groups\n\naccording to the PM jobs, and not according to the measured MOs. Therefore, measurements\n\nfrom the same MO included in different PM jobs are reported in different places in the\n\nROP file.\n\nAfter a restart of the Network Element, one ROP file is\n\nalways lost. If the restart occurs at the end of one ROP and the start of another one,\n\ntwo ROP files are lost.\n\nOnly complete ROPs are made available in a PM Counter ROP\n\nfile. If a program restarts, it cannot provide complete data during the restart time.\n\nTherefore, counters provided by the program are discarded for each incomplete ROP.\n\nIf a single counter or subset of the counters for an MO\n\ninstance and PM job are considered unreliable, PM counters can be flagged as suspect in\n\nthe ROP file. The suspect flag is set and the counter value is reported as a blank\n\nspace.\n\n### 1.4.3 Measurement Methods for Performance Statistics\n\nPerformance statistics are measured using the following measurement\n\nmethods:\n\n| Accumulative Counter   |    | An Accumulative Counter measurement increases by the value of a sample.

The range measurement increases every             time a sample of a single variable is measured to lie within the range for that range             measurement.  In this example, a variable is used to measure processor load utilization, with sampled             values split into four ranges as follows:    Range1 = [0..25]%      Range2 = [26..50]%     Range3 = [51..75]%     Range4 =                 [76..100]%     A sampled value is read every third minute over a 15-minute period with values [23, 88,             66, 52, 43]. Then the four range measurements would be reported as:    Range1 = 1     Range2 = 1     Range3 = 2     Range4 = 1     The PDF measurement format can also be used as a generic array of separate measurement,             where each measurement measures a different variable. |\n|                        |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Compressed PDF         |    | A             compressed PDF measurement reports only the non-zero values. It can be used for a small             part of the range.  Example: The QCI PM measurements are arrays of PM measurements with no relationship             between the QCI values. A QCI PM measurement measures the number of establishment             attempts per QCI made by the E-RABs. Each element of the array is an Accumulative             Counter measurement that counts the number of E-RAB establishment attempts for a             specific QCI value.  In the following example the measurement result for a QCI [256] is as follows:    [0] = 0     [1] = 72     [2] = 0     [3] = 0     [4]                 = 0     [5] = 0     [6] = 44     [7] = 0     [8] = 0     [9] = 0     [255] = 0     Two QCI values are reported during the ROP: QCI1 has 72 attempts and QCI6 has 44             attempts. The first number in the result is the number of reported bins followed by bin             and bin values in pairs. Then the result in compressed PDF format is: 2, 1, 72, 6, 44.                  |\n|                        |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Percentile             |    | A percentile is a measurement indicating the value below which a given percentage of             observations in a group of observations fall.

The type is\n\nfurther divided into PM areas and the areas into traffic scenarios or KPI formulas.\n\nThe common PM areas used for both traffic and KPI are as follows:\n\n- Accessibility\n- Availability\n- Integrity\n- Mobility\n- Retainability\n- Utilization\n\nThree more areas are used only for the traffic category type:\n\n- Equipment\n- IP O&amp;M\n- Transport Network\n\nThe Managed Object Model (MOM) PM Counters folder in the CPI library has a filtering\n\nfunction to narrow down the list of counters to a subset applicable to a particular\n\nobservability use case. For example, filtering by Traffic, Utilization and Baseband\n\nResources renders a list of only eight individual counters, out of around four thousand\n\ncounters present in the MOM.\n\nExample 1   pmLcgThpVolUlLcg\n\n```\nType: Traffic, Area: Integrity, Scenario: Throughput\nType: Traffic, Area: Utilization, Scenario: Volume\nType: KPI, Area: Integrity, Scenario: UplinkThroughput\n```\n\n### 1.4.5 Flexible Counters\n\nFlexible counters make it possible to define a counter for any combination of filter\n\nparameters, without the need to define counters for all combinations.\n\nFlexible counters can be differentiated by operator-configurable filter parameters in\n\nrun-time. Flexible counters provide a framework for differentiated observability to be\n\nable to produce flexible counters.\n\nSub-flexible\n\ncounters allow for stepping and interpreting flexible\n\ncounters.\n\nSub-flexible\n\ncounters are dynamically created in run-time depending on configured filter parameters\n\nand are stored in ROP files.\n\nFor more information, see the document Flexible Counters.\n\nRelated tasks\n\nActivate Flexible Counters\n\n#### 1.4.5.1 Filter Parameters for Flexible Counters\n\nThe Flexible Counters feature introduces the filter MO PmFlexCounterFilter to configure filter parameters for\n\nflexible counters. The following filter parameters are supported:\n\n- Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP)\n- Coverage Enhancement (CE) Level\n- E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity (ENDC)\n- LCG\n- PLMN Index\n- QCI\n- SPID\n- UE Category\n- UE Power Class\n- Subscriber Group\n\nRelated tasks\n\nActivate Flexible Counters\n\n## 1.5 Direct Access to Performance Statistics\n\nFor network troubleshooting, direct access to performance\n\nstatistics\n\nis\n\nprovided. With direct access, real-time values are read without waiting for the Result\n\nOut Period to finish. Measurements with references to an MO instance can also be\n\nlisted.\n\nThe majority of the measurements can be accessed directly and\n\nincluded in a PM job at the same\n\ntime;\n\nsome are dedicated for troubleshooting and can only be accessed directly. The direct\n\naccess reading does not disturb the measuring in an active PM job.\n\nThe values of selected or all measurements with direct access\n\nare read using command show-counters in Ericsson CLI and EMCLI. For\n\nmore information on the show-counters command, see\n\nEricsson CLI.\n\nIt is possible to manually display the values of counters\n\nassociated with an MO instance. To do this,\n\nnavigate\n\nto the MO instance\n\nin the Ericsson CLI and issue the show-counters\n\ncommand. A single counter can be displayed by specifying its name on the command\n\nline.\n\nSub-flexible counters can be displayed if a counter name starting with\n\npmFlex is specified and a filter configuration (using the\n\nPmFlexCounterFilter MO class) is configured. For more information, see\n\nFlexible Counters.\n\nIf no counter name is specified, all counters associated with the MO instance are\n\ndisplayed.\n\n## 1.6 Performance Events\n\nA performance event is a recording of a number of parameters describing a specific\n\ntraffic event for a specific UE or from operator-selected cells. A performance event is\n\ncreated when the traffic event occurs, for example, when a UE makes a handover to\n\nanother cell.\n\nData anonymization for performance events containing sensitive data is enabled by default\n\nto protect end-user privacy. For more information, see Manage Security.\n\nThe performance event list can be downloaded by clicking on\n\nthe appropriate link, see Manage Lists.\n\nThe following types of event recording functions exist:\n\n- Cell Trace\n- UE Trace\n\nBoth recording functions support output to either file or stream, or file and stream\n\nsimultaneously.\n\nFiles are closed at the end of each ROP. Performance events associated with UEs, LCGs,\n\nand radio bearers can be lost in the current ROP file if the selected UE is attached too\n\nclose (within 2 seconds) to the end of the ROP.\n\n### 1.6.1 Cell Trace\n\nThe Cell Trace function records performance events from all\n\nUEs, or a part of them, in one or more selected cells that belong to the same RBS. It\n\nprovides monitoring and evaluation capability of any traffic scenario, and gives\n\nvisibility of air interface quality and UE performance. When a new RBS is deployed, or a\n\nnew feature or frequency is deployed within an existing RBS, Cell Trace is used for\n\ntroubleshooting and optimization of the network.\n\nSix Cell Trace recordings are prepared at delivery. This is\n\nthe maximum number of recordings that can be active simultaneously at the same network\n\nelement (NE).\n\nIn one of these six recordings, the events to record are\n\npredefined. This recording is called Continuous Cell Trace Recording (CCTR). The CCTR is\n\nactivated and starts recording automatically at the startup of the NE. It is deactivated\n\nand stops recording only when the NE is shut down.\n\nThe CCTR job is predefined on the node and it includes predefined events to be traced.\n\nThere is only one instance of CCTR subscription type in OSS and\n\nit is automatically created with state INACTIVE when the first eNodeB\n\nis added to the OSS. Only the predefined CCTR job is\n\nsupported.\n\nAs additional nodes of relevant node types are added to the network, they are not added\n\nto system defined subscriptions at the time of adding them to the OSS system. OSS will run an Audit at\n\nscheduled intervals to update the system defined subscriptions with any new relevant\n\nnode added to the system. The default intervals for Audit running are 15-minute\n\nintervals.\n\nIn the other five prepared recordings, the events to record are defined by the operator.\n\nThese are activated and deactivated by the operator.\n\nThe CCTR and one of the operator-defined recordings are\n\nhigh-priority recordings. The other four recordings are normal priority recordings.\n\nThe starting and stopping of a cell trace recording is made\n\nin the OSS through an event job. In the MOM, an event job is represented by an instance\n\nof MO EventProducer.EventJob.\n\nThe recommendation for the continuous collection of pmEvents\n\nis to use the CCTR profile (OSS Event Group) that is listed in document PM Event List\n\nand delivered by streaming. See Trace Event Streaming. This to minimize the risk for\n\npmEvent data loss at the varying traffic.\n\n### 1.6.2 UE Trace\n\nUE Trace records performance events from individual, operator-selected UEs that travel\n\nthrough a network. Radio events can be recorded for both the uplink and the downlink. These\n\nrecordings allow the network operator to identify parameters that must be adjusted,\n\nparticularly after changes made to or extension of the network.\n\nUE Trace recordings are controlled from the MME.\n\nNetwork elements record radio events associated with a UE when it is in the coverage area of\n\nthe network elements. As the UE leaves the coverage area and it is passed over to the next\n\nnetwork element, the configuration data of the trace recording moves with the UE. Based on the\n\nconfiguration data, performance events are written to files or streamed to an external\n\nreceiver, or both. If events are written to files, they are collected by the OSS following the Cell Trace ROP period. Selected UEs are identified by\n\ntheir IMSI or IMEI within the MME or by the OSS. Within the RAN, the\n\ntrace session for a UE is uniquely identified by a trace reference.\n\nA maximum of 16 UEs can be recorded simultaneously at each network element.\n\nUE Trace includes support for UE type and external type PM events, and several\n\nnon-UE-specific events related to the cell or the RBS.\n\nThe network element can be configured to filter any PM event, such as non-UE-specific events.\n\nThis filtering is not job-specific. It helps alleviate resource constraints of the file or\n\nstream solution. The external event S1\\_PAGING is filtered by default. If this event is not\n\nfiltered, it is recommended to have no more than eight UE Trace recordings active at the same\n\ntime. This is to avoid main processor overload. In these high load scenarios, the preferred UE\n\nTrace output solution is streaming.\n\n### 1.6.3 Performance Events Data Files\n\nThe recorded data consists of Cell Trace and UE Trace recordings, standardized and\n\nproprietary events. For detailed information about the performance events file format,\n\nsee Performance Event Format.\n\nThe Cell Trace recordings are presented in three ROP files for each Managed Function at\n\nthe end of every ROP. Two of the ROP files contain the results from the high priority\n\nevent jobs. One contains the results from the normal event jobs. The result of each UE\n\nTrace recording is presented in one ROP file. The ROP duration is 15 minutes.\n\nA UE trace session is identified by a trace reference, which is part of the file name and\n\ncommonly used for all network elements involved in the UE Trace. UE Trace files are\n\nclosed at the end of the ROP in the same manner as Cell Trace files. A single UE Trace\n\nfile has multiple trace recording sessions if the UE becomes active multiple times\n\nwithin the same ROP.\n\nPerformance Events data files contain compressed PM events for each ROP and are stored on\n\nthe Network Element.\n\nPM event retention can be controlled for an even producer, such as LRAT, by configuring a\n\nmaximum file size for each of the three file types (CCTR, Normal Priority and High\n\nPriority). However, configuration of a larger maximum file size does not guarantee that\n\nthe space is available, as PM Event storage is ultimately limited by the size of the RAM\n\ndisk used to store all the files. For eNodeB deployments, RAN Compute\n\ngroups\n\n4\n\nand 5 have a 270MB RAM\n\ndisk.\n\nFor more information on RAN Compute\n\ngroups,\n\nsee DU and Baseband Configurations and Capacity.\n\nWhen the RAM disk is 270MB, the CCTR job and the High Priority job each have a dedicated\n\nfile with a maximum configurable size of 30MB and the remaining 4 Normal Priority jobs\n\nshare a Normal Priority file which has a maximum configurable size of 100MB. When the\n\nRAM disk size is 135MB, the maximum configurable sizes are halved (CCTR and High\n\nPriority: 15MB, Normal Priority: 50MB).\n\nThe maximum configurable size of each UE trace file is 1000 kilobytes (compressed).\n\nHow long ROP files remain at the Network Element depends on the ROP file size and\n\navailable storage space. The ROP files are continuously collected by the OSS for analysis and storage.\n\nCell and UE Trace ROP files are deleted by the node if they are more than 25 hours old.\n\nNewer files are removed when the RAM disk reaches the 95% full threshold. The 95%\n\nthreshold means that for a 270MB RAM disk only 95% (256MB) is available. Another\n\nconsideration is that ENM needs time to collect the ROP files. If ENM takes a full ROP\n\nto collect files, then space is required to store two ROP of PM Event files. This means\n\n128MB of PM Event data can be stored in files per ROP. ENM file recovery requires that 3\n\nROP are stored on disk (the current ROP plus 2). This requires cell and UE trace data\n\nvolumes to not exceed 85MB per ROP. For a 135MB RAM disk, 128MB becomes 64MB for two\n\nROP, and 42.5 for three ROP.\n\nFor more information on ENM file recovery, see ENM System Capacity CPI.\n\nWhen the RAM disk reaches the 95% threshold and with space only available for less than\n\nfour ROP, file removal considers both age and priority of the ROP files. Normal Priority\n\nfile is overwritten ahead of the High Priority file and the High Priority file is\n\noverwritten ahead of the CCTR file. When a file is overwritten, it is replaced with a\n\nfile containing a single PM Event\n\n(INTERNAL\\_EVENT\\_FILE\\_CONTENT\\_REMOVED\\_FOR\\_HIGHER\\_PRIORITY\\_FILES).\n\nAdditionally, the current incomplete ROP file is removed ahead of the first previous ROP\n\nfile. CCTR files for the current and previous ROP have the highest priority and are\n\nnever removed.\n\nIncreasing the Normal Priority maximum file size beyond 30MB means that potentially more\n\nPM Events may be collected by ENM per ROP. For ENM PMIC storage scalability, EBS\n\nprocessing capacity, and bandwidth considerations see ENM System Capacity\n\nCPI.\n\nThe Trace Event Streaming feature allows streaming live cell\n\ntrace events through TCP socket connection to a customer node. When the performance\n\nevent data is streamed, each recording is handled as a separate data stream. With this\n\nfeature, the data is sent after every event occurrence.\n\nStandardized events are Layer 3 protocol messages, which are stored as they appear on the\n\nexternal protocol interfaces. They are stored in an ASN.1-encoded format that is\n\nconverted to a bit-packed binary format. By default, external event data is included in\n\nthe performance event data file, but can be excluded through configuration. All other,\n\nnonstandardized events are proprietary and encoded in .gpb format. For more information\n\nabout Layer 3, see Transport Network Functions.\n\nThe ROP files are compressed using GZIP.\n\nAt Network Element restart, all cell trace recording ROP files are removed from the\n\nNetwork Element file system.\n\n### 1.6.4 Performance Events MOM\n\nIn the MOM, the performance event recordings for Cell Trace are managed in the\n\nPmEventM MO class. Each performance event recording is represented by an\n\ninstance of the EventType MO class. PM events are grouped in the\n\nEventGroup MO class but can also be used separately.\n\nThe start of a performance event recording is made in the OSS through\n\nan event job. In the MOM, an event job is represented by an instance of the\n\nEventJob MO class.\n\nAfter a restart of the Network Element, the state of the event job is the same as before the\n\nrestart.\n\nMOM attributes for UE Trace include the configuration of the UDP streaming port using the\n\nPmEventService.streamPortPmUeTrace attribute, and events to be filtered\n\nfrom all UE Trace jobs managed under the EventGroupS.ueTraceEventFilterlist\n\nattribute. The general management of UE Trace jobs is controlled by the OSS provisioning of the job on the MME.\n\nFor detailed information about performance event recordings, see Managed Object Model (MOM).\n\n## 1.7 Robust PM Handling at High Load on eNodeB\n\nThe probability of node crash in very high traffic load situations can be reduced by\n\nconfigurable reduced observability modes.\n\nIn reduced observability modes some PM events or counters or other observability methods\n\nare suspended, depending on configuration. This results in less effective observability\n\non the node. In reduced observability mode, the eNodeB does not provide events for the\n\nfollowing:\n\n- Exception log\n- Local event log\n- UE trace and cell trace, depending on the reduced observability level\n- Counters, depending on the reduced observability level Note: Counters that are not stepped due to reduced observability being active are marked as suspect in the ROP file.\n\nRobust PM handling can be configured by the following MOM attributes:\n\n- ENodeBFunction.obsMode\n- ENodeBFunction.obsProtectionAutoTargetMode\n- ENodeBFunction.obsStatus\n\nThe following counters can be used to monitor robust PM handling:\n\n- ENodeBFunction.pmObsLocalEventDiscPmLoad\n- EUtranCellFDD.pmObsLocalEventDiscPmLoad\n- EUtranCellTDD.pmObsLocalEventDiscPmLoad\n\n## 1.8 Event Based Statistics for LTE (EBS-L)\n\nThe optional EBS-L application provides additional PM statistics produced from PM\n\nevents.\n\nEBS-L is an OSS application that enables generating 3GPP compliant counter files off the\n\nnode. EBS-L provides more detailed PM statistics, for example Performance Event failure\n\ncauses as individual PM counters.\n\nAll EBS PM counters are fully integrated with the node and other PM counter handling\n\nproducts (such as ENIQ-S). For example, the initiation of the RAN Performance Events\n\nneeded for EBS Performance Statistic production, is managed by the PM Initiation and\n\nCollection (PMIC) application.\n\nEBS counters are also known as OSS counters.\n\nFor detailed information, see the Event Based Statistics for LTE (EBS-L)\n\nchapter in the Network Impact Report in Ericsson Network\n\nManager CPI library and PM Initiation and Collection in\n\nENM Online Help CPI Library. The details are also available in\n\nEricsson Network IQ Statistics (ENIQ-S) CPI library.\n\nFor detailed list of EBS-L counters, see List and Delta Lists.\n\n# 2 Performance Management Actions\n\nThe following procedures can be performed to user-defined PM\n\njobs:\n\n- Creating user-defined PM jobs\n- Starting user-defined PM jobs\n- Modifying user-defined PM jobs\n- Stopping user-defined PM jobs\n- Deleting user-defined PM jobs\n\nThe predefined PM jobs that are included at delivery can only be started and stopped.\n\nFrom the performance event recordings, only Cell Trace event jobs are managed at the Network\n\nElement. The user defined Cell Trace event jobs can be modified, started, and stopped. The\n\npredefined CCTR cannot be modified.\n\nThe following procedures can be performed to cell trace event jobs:\n\n- Starting cell trace event jobs\n- Stopping cell trace event jobs\n- Modifying cell trace event jobs\n\nThe following procedures can be performed to UE trace event jobs:\n\n- Starting UE trace event jobs\n- Stopping UE trace event jobs\n- Modifying UE trace event jobs\n\n## 2.1 Create PM Job\n\nSteps\n\n- Create a new PmJob MO instance. Result: The PmJob.requestedJobState attribute of the newly created instance is set to ACTIVE by default. If multiple ROP files are configured, the PmJob.jobGroup attribute of the MO instance is set to one of the following values, based on which RAT it is valid for: GSM WCDMA LTE If the MO instance is not related to any specific RAT, its PmJob.jobGroup attribute is not set.\n\n## 2.2 Start PM Job\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA PmJob MO instance for a PM job is created.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Create a MeasurementReader MO instance under the PmJob MO for each MeasurementType or PmGroup MO instance. Result: The PmJob.currentJobState attribute is set to ACTIVE which initiates performance statistics measurements. ROP files are created starting from the first complete result output period.\n\n## 2.3 Stop PM Job\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA PM job is active.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Set the PmJob.requestedJobState attribute to STOPPED. Result: The system sets the attribute PmJob.currentJobState to STOPPED, which stops performance statistics measurements. If the measurement stops during a Result Out Period, no ROP file is created. Restarting a stopped PM job is done by starting a PM job.\n\nRelated Information\n\nStart PM Job\n\n## 2.4 Modify a PM Job\n\nSteps\n\n1. Add or remove one or more desired PmJob.MeasurementReader MO attributes that represent the PM job that is to be modified. The desired MeasurementType or PmGroup MO instances are referenced by the mandatory MeasurementReader.measurementSpecification MO attribute.\n\nResults\n\nThe measurement result of the modified PM job is reported in the next ROP file.\n\n## 2.5 Delete a User-Defined PM Job\n\nSteps\n\n1. Set the PmJob.requestedJobState MO attribute of the PM job that is to be deleted to STOPPED. Result: The PmJob.currentJobState attribute is set to STOPPED by the system and the measurement is stopped.\n2. Delete the PmJob MO instance.\n\n## 2.6 Create PM Job Groups\n\nPM jobs can be grouped together into PM job groups to use a separate group-specific ROP file for measurements.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Set the PmJob.jobGroup attribute for each PmJob MO instance to be included in the PM job group to the same value.\n2. Set PmSupport.ropFileHandling to MULTIPLE\\_ROP\\_FILES.\n\n## 2.7 List PM Job\n\nSteps\n\n1. Use the show command in Ericsson CLI and EMCLI. It is possible to manually display the PM jobs associated with an MO instance. To do this, in the Ericsson CLI navigate to the MO instance and issue the show command. For more information on the show command, see Ericsson CLI.\n\n## 2.8 Modify Cell Trace Event Job\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe events to be included or excluded and attributes that are to be changed are\n\nidentified.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Ensure that the value of the EventJob.requestedJobState attribute is set to STOPPED.\n2. Set the EventJob.eventGroupRef or EventJob.eventTypeRef attribute to include events to be recorded.\n3. To specify the cell or cells to record, set the CellFilter attribute to a list of Local Distinguished Names of cells, separated by semicolons.\n4. To specify a fraction of the UEs in a cell to record, set attribute UeFraction to a value between 0 to 1000. A value of 500 means that 50% of the UEs in a cell is recorded.\n5. To include or exclude the ASN.1 format of external events data, set the EventJob.EventFilter attribute.\n6. Set the event producer, such as LRAT FileTypes=1:FileType.fileSizePercent attribute to a value between 1 and 100 to specify the percentage of the FileType.fileSizeMax attribute to be used as the maximum file size for the CCTR, High Priority, or Normal Priority file. Note: The FileTypes=1:FileType.fileSizePercent attribute is overwritten with the value provided by the event producer after a software upgrade. If the value is manually set to a value other than the default value set by the producer, the value must be manually set again after the upgrade to avoid PM event loss.\n7. If the Streaming of PM Events feature is to be used with the stream destination provided as IP addresses, set the following attributes:\n    1. Set the value of the EventJob.streamOutputEnabled to true.\n    2. Enter the address of the server to which event data must be streamed in the EventJob.streamDestinationIpAddress attribute.\n    3. Enter the server port to which event data must be streamed in the EventJob.streamDestinationPort attribute.\n8. If the Streaming of PM Events feature is to be used with the stream destination provided as FQDNs, set the following attributes: Performance event ROP files are created also if streaming is used. To use streaming only, set the value of the EventJob.fileOutputEnabled to false.\n    1. Enter the FQDN of the server to which event data must be streamed in the EventJob.streamDestination attribute.\n    2. If the server port to which event data must be streamed is not already provided as part of FQDN as set in EventJob.streamDestination, enter the server port in the EventJob.streamDestinationPort attribute.\n    3. Set the value of the EventJob.streamOutputEnabled attribute to true.\n\n## 2.9 Start Cell Trace Event Job\n\nTo start a Cell Trace event job:\n\nSteps\n\n1. Set attribute requestedJobState TOOLTIPFLAG to ACTIVE. The NE first sets attribute currentJobState TOOLTIPFLAG on MO EventJob TOOLTIPFLAG to ACTIVATING, then to ACTIVE. After that, the recording starts.\n\n## 2.10 Stop Cell Trace Event Job\n\nTo stop a Cell Trace event job:\n\nSteps\n\n1. Set attribute requestedJobState TOOLTIPFLAG to STOPPED. The NE first sets attribute currentJobState TOOLTIPFLAG on MO EventJob TOOLTIPFLAG to DEACTIVATING, then to STOPPED. After that, the recording is stopped. If the recording results are streamed, the streaming is stopped. If the recording results are saved in ROP files, the footer of the open files are written and the files are closed.\n\n## 2.11 Preparing for UE Trace\n\nThe primary event filtering mechanisms for UE Trace are setting the trace depth and\n\ninterfaces to trace. These are configured when the UE Trace is activated.\n\n### 2.11.1 Configure Custom Filtering of Events for UE Trace\n\nThis additional filtering can be used to remove high-frequency, non-UE-specific\n\nevents from all UE Trace jobs. This frees up resources for other events.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Configure the EventGroupS.ueTraceEventFilterlist attribute to enable additional filtering of specific events produced by the eNodeB regardless of the trace depth and interfaces to trace. The S1\\_PAGING message is filtered by default. It is recommended to maintain the default filtering of S1\\_PAGING in EventGroupS.ueTraceEventFilterlist.\n    1. Use Lists and Delta Lists Baseband to identify high-frequency, non-UE-specific events with the following parameters: Event Type: RBS or Cell OSS protocol: INTERNAL\\_PERIODIC OSS Event Group: UETR\\_ONLY\n    2. Add the names of some or all of these events to EventGroupS.ueTraceEventFilterlist using regular configuration management tools to reduce the trace scope. For more information, see Manage Lists and Lists and Delta Lists Baseband.\n\n### 2.11.2 Configure Streaming of Events for UE Trace\n\nSteps\n\n1. Configure PmEventService.streamPortPmUeTrace on the eNodeB if UDP streaming is used as an output method.\n\n## 2.12 Start UE Trace\n\nFor the activation of one or more events, the\n\nuser has to define a UE Trace subscription. A UE Trace subscription is an entity in the\n\nOSS that helps users to manipulate event administration.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe desired events to be produced by the network element must be considered\n\ncarefully. Any PM event can be filtered by adding the name of the PM event contained\n\nin the EventTypeS.eventTypeSId attribute to the\n\nEventGroupS.ueTraceEventFilterlist attribute.\n\nThe S1\\_PAGING event is present by default in the filterlist. It is recommended not to\n\nremove it and to always have it filtered.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Choose Subscription Type and choose the subscription type UE Trace recording subscription.\n2. Enter a name to be associated with this subscription. Optionally, enter a user comment about the subscription.\n3. Select Output Mode. The IP address of the receiving system must be entered if STREAMING or FILE\\_AND\\_STREAMING is selected.The NR managed functions do not support file and stream output in the same job. If FILE\\_AND\\_STREAMING is selected, the eNodeB provides both file and stream output, but the gNodeB-CU-CP and gNodeB-DU managed functions only provides file output.\n4. Choose a trace type and the trace depth.\n5. Enter the IMSI or IMEI or IMEISV number. IMSI is chosen by default. Choose one of the following RBS trace depths: Maximum Minimum Medium MinimumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension MediumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension MaximumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension Maximum and MaximumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension trace depths include ASN.1 content for external events from the RBS. External events can also be captured at Minimum and MinimumWithoutVendorSpecificExtension trace depths without ASN.1 content. The MME always provides Maximum trace depth.\n6. Select Interface Types. Select the interface types to be traced for the eNodeB and the MME from the corresponding lists.\n7. Set Subscription Scheduling. A user-defined statistics subscription can be defined as Scheduled, which means that the subscription starts at a specified point in time and stops after a specified duration.\n\n## 2.13 Modify UE Trace\n\nA UE Trace subscription can be suspended or resumed by changing the state of the\n\nsubscription in the OSS. If the UE Trace subscription is\n\nactive and it needs to be modified, it must be suspended first.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Set the state of the active UE Trace subscription to inactive to suspend the subscription.\n2. Modify the subscription.\n3. Set the state of the inactive UE Trace subscription to active to resume the subscription.\n\n## 2.14 Stop UE Trace\n\nA UE Trace subscription is stopped by changing the state of the subscription in the\n\nOSS.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Set the state of the active UE Trace subscription to inactive to suspend the subscription.\n\nResults\n\nUE Trace is stopped.\n\n## 2.15 Activate Flexible Counters\n\nSteps\n\n1. Create the filter MO PmFlexCounterFilter and configure it for filter parameters configuration for Flexible Counters. Configure one or more filter MO instances as enabled. Each filter MO instance must be different from each other. The validator prevents the same configuration from being repeated.\n2. Activate a user-defined job for selected flexible counters. The collected values for sub flexible counters are stored in ROP files every 15 minutes.\n\nRelated concepts\n\nFlexible Counters\n\nFilter Parameters for Flexible Counters",

Users can be multiplexed and scheduled\n\nin time, efficiently using spectral and hardware resources to optimize user\n\nthroughput and cell capacity.\n\nScheduling is done dynamically for every slot. For every\n\nupcoming slot, the Scheduler determines which users are assigned radio interface and\n\nradio node resources.\n\nThe Scheduler is a basic feature, and it is a part of radio resource management.\n\nThe single-user scenario applies single-layer data transmission. The scheduler\n\ntransmits one code word for each physical layer to choose MCSs for downlink or\n\nuplink transmissions.\n\nThe feature allows multiple users to schedule downlink and uplink user-plane traffic\n\nin cells that include multiple DRBs for\n\neach UE.\n\nThe Scheduler feature also supports the following functions:\n\n- Timing alignment\n- Uplink scheduling triggered by a Scheduling Request (SR) on PUCCH\n- Increased robustness of small downlink data\n\nFigure 1   Scheduler Overview\n\nAdditional Information\n\n- 3GPP Release 15\n\n# 2 Dependencies of Scheduler Low-Band\n\nThe Scheduler Low-Band feature is related to features that can affect the scheduling\n\nprocess and features that can affect MCS selection.\n\nTable 1   Feature Dependencies\n\n| Feature                                                                                                       | Relationship   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Link Adaptation for Low Target BLER for                                     Dedicated RAN (FAJ 121 5667)      | Related        | The increased robustness of small downlink data function is not             adapted to the low target BLER.

If data is available on downlink data transmission, downlink scheduling candidates are sent to the Scheduler.\n2. Scheduling candidates are sent to the Scheduler with the assumption that the UE has a full buffer of data.\n3. At the beginning of each slot, the Scheduler receives scheduling candidates and information on radio resources.\n4. If resources are available and there are relevant downlink or uplink scheduling candidates, the Scheduler allocates an appropriate amount of resources to the UE. PRBs are allocated as scheduling elements to available slots.\n\n## 3.1 Scheduling Request for Low-Band\n\nA Scheduling Request (SR) is used by the UE for requesting PUSCH resources for a new\n\nPUSCH transmission.\n\nIn NR, the SR is configured on the logical channel level, not on the UE level as in\n\nLTE.\n\nThe MAC entity can be configured with zero, one, or more SRs. An SR configuration\n\nconsists of a set of PUCCH resources for SRs across different BWPs and cells. For each\n\nlogical channel, one PUCCH resource is configured per BWP for SRs.\n\nThe number of PRBs used for PUCCH format 1 is dynamically increased when there are many\n\nconnected UEs and more SR resources are necessary. To achieve this, PRBs initially used\n\nfor PUSCH are temporarily converted to PUCCH. This results in better uplink resource use\n\nand higher PUSCH throughput when the number of connected UEs is lower.\n\nInitially, one PUCCH PRB pair is available for SRs at cell unlock. When\n\nSR resources from this first PRB pair are exhausted, more PRB pairs are configured\n\ndynamically for PUCCH. PRBs are taken from PUSCH for this reason. UE grouping and 5QI\n\nconfiguration are not considered in SR resource allocation.\n\nFor SR resource allocation, UEs can be assigned to the following SR\n\nperiodicity\n\npools:\n\n- Short\n- Common\n- Long\n\nThe process of assigning UEs to the SR periodicity pools is\n\nhandled with the following logic in the order of the UEs connecting to the network:\n\n1. The first UE to connect to the network gets SR periodicity resources from the short SR periodicity pool.\n2. If the short pool is exhausted, the UEs that connect afterward are assigned resources from the common SR periodicity pool.\n3. If the common pool is exhausted, all further UEs that connect are assigned SR periodicity resources from the maximum SR periodicity pool.\n\nBy default, SRs have high priority. SR priority can be configured using the\n\nQoS-controlled SR scheduling function of the QoS Framework feature.\n\nRelated Information\n\nQoS Framework\n\nNR Service-Adaptive SR Configuration\n\n## 3.2 Scheduling Channels\n\nThe feature uses different resources in the downlink and the uplink\n\nchannels.\n\nTable 2   Resources for Downlink and Uplink Scheduling\n\n| Direction   | Resources                                                            | Description                                                                                                       |\n|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Downlink    | PDSCH resources (PRBs and symbols)     PDCCH resources     CSI-RS(1) | Downlink scheduling resides entirely in the node.                                                                 |\n| Uplink      | PUSCH resources (PRBs and symbols)     PUCCH resources               | In the uplink, both the node and the UE are involved in the                                 scheduling procedure. |\n\n(1)\n\nCSI-RS is used for the TRS only\n\n## 3.3 Data Transmission\n\nScheduler Low-Band only supports FDD.

In this way, performance information is prioritized instead of uplink\n\ndata throughput.\n\nHARQ\n\nIn NR, HARQ has the following characteristics both in the downlink and in the\n\nuplink:\n\n| Asynchronous   |    | No predefined timing for retransmissions occurs.

At the beginning of each slot, the Scheduler receives the following information: List of available PRBs and symbols for PDSCH PDCCH resources Scheduling candidates for transmitting data Estimate of current radio conditions Number of OFDM symbols for user data transmission\n2. The network transmits downlink data for the UE, triggering scheduling requests that can be scheduled at the selected slot. In downlink, scheduling candidates are based on downlink buffer status.\n3. The Scheduler assigns an appropriate number of PRBs to the UE with any selected MCS. The MCS allows one code word to be transmitted over the air with up to four downlink layers.\n4. Scheduling information is sent to the UE through a downlink grant with the format DCI1\\_1 at PDCCH, transmitted at the same slot as for PDSCH transmission (k0=0).\n5. The PUCCH resources and one of the configured timings (K1) for the HARQ-ACK feedback of the UE is indicated in the same downlink grant.\n\n## 3.6 Process Steps for Uplink Scheduling\n\nUplink scheduling involves reserving resources for uplink user plane data based on\n\nprevailing conditions.\n\nSteps\n\n1. At the beginning of each slot, the Scheduler receives the following information: List of available PRBs, and symbols for PUSCH Candidates to be scheduled in uplink with data to transmit Estimate of current radio conditions (channel quality) Number of OFDM symbols for user data transmission PUCCH and PRACH have absolute priority over other control and user data channels in the uplink. The scheduling element resources for uplink scheduling are not used by PUCCH and PRACH.\n2. When a UE is scheduled in a slot, the Scheduler allocates resources to the UE. For the uplink, scheduling candidates are either prescheduled or determined by the BSR.\n3. The Scheduler sends a scheduling grant to the scheduled UE with the DCI format DCI0\\_1. This also indicates one of the configured timings from the grant to the assigned uplink slot (K2). Uplink grants are sent on PDCCH. A selected MCS and one layer are indicated in the uplink grant. Uplink scheduling can be triggered by the following grants: A scheduling grant after content resolution message using BSR A grant triggered by prescheduling at low-load scenarios A Scheduling Request (SR) triggered grant\n4. The UE transmits the uplink data on the scheduled PRBs at the desired uplink slot to the node.\n\n## 3.7 Scheduling Algorithm for Low-Band\n\nSummary\n\nResource-fair scheduling is used. Multiple downlink and uplink scheduling candidates\n\nare sent to the scheduler. In the downlink, scheduling candidates are based on\n\ndownlink buffer status. In the uplink, devices are scheduled either based on the\n\nPUCCH scheduling request, the BSR, or prescheduling.\n\nAn increased number of PDSCH and PUSCH scheduling entities requires the support of\n\nPDCCH resources. Downlink and uplink PDCCH scheduling elements are supported in each\n\nslot and cell. In the downlink, link adaptation allows for processing scheduling\n\nentities in each slot and cell.\n\nThe allocation of downlink and uplink scheduling entities in each slot provides the\n\nopportunity to decrease the RTT latency when there are more connected users. Lower\n\nlatency can provide increased TCP throughput.\n\nNR PDCCH Link Adaptation\n\nThe functionality allocates as few CCEs as possible for DCI transmission in\n\nuser-specific control signaling. Capacity increases in terms of SE/TTI around the\n\ncell center. Using the largest aggregation level allows for an increase in PDCCH\n\ncoverage.\n\n## 3.8 Measurement Gap Handling for Scheduler Low-Band and Mid-Band\n\nUEs can be configured with a measurement gap in\n\nEN-DC,\n\nNR-DC, and NR standalone\n\ndeployments.\n\nIf\n\nthe UE is configured with a measurement gap, the UE is not scheduled for downlink and\n\nuplink transmission during the measurement gap, except for the Random Access\n\nprocedure. If the measurement gap prevents the scheduling requests\n\nfrom registering, the scheduling request resources are reconfigured.\n\nUEs that support measurement gap requirement information reporting can be requested to\n\nreport if a measurement gap is required for NR intra-system measurements.\n\nIn an EN-DC configuration, the measurement gap is transferred to the Secondary Node\n\nscheduler if the measurement gap is configured or removed for the frequencies of the\n\nserving cells in the SCG.\n\nIn an NR-DC configuration, the measurement gap on the Master Node is only forwarded to\n\nthe Secondary Node scheduler if the measurement gap is configured for all\n\nfrequencies,\n\nand the measurement gap configuration is changed.\n\nFor more information, see Measurement Gap-Aware NR Scheduling.\n\n## 3.9 Increased Robustness of Small Downlink Data\n\nThe increased robustness of small downlink data function reduces MCS for small\n\ndownlink data.\n\nPadding bits for small data transmissions cause high BLER for all services and high\n\npacket loss for VoNR. The robustness of small downlink data transmissions can be\n\nincreased by reducing MCS during link adaptation, which leads to the conversion of\n\npadding bits to coding bits.\n\nEnabling the increased robustness of small downlink data function decreases downlink HARQ\n\nBLER and VoNR packet loss, along with more robust small downlink data transmissions.\n\nMCS reduction is only possible if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n- Type 0 downlink resource allocation is used.\n- MCS Table 1 or MCS Table 2 is used.\n\nThe function might increase the number of downlink RLC retransmissions. The increased\n\nnumber of downlink RLC retransmissions can be observed through the\n\nNRCellDU.pmRlcArqDlNack PM counter.\n\n## 3.10 PUSCH Power Control\n\nThe feature can simplify the P0 value adaptation, which optimizes the power control\n\nconfiguration.\n\nThe feature can simplify the P0 value adaptation, which optimizes the power control\n\nconfiguration. The P0 value is the initial uplink received PSD power of every connected\n\nUE for the first transmission.\n\nThe value can be set manually or automatically, using the\n\nNRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant attribute.\n\nWhen the value of the NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant attribute is set to\n\n1000, the system selects a P0 value for the\n\nNRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschAutoSelected attribute.\n\nThe P0 value is optimized for every radio deployment and aims to\n\nmaintain peak uplink throughput and to reduce interference, as well as to prevent\n\nnetwork imbalances. The optimization is based on the radio\n\nunit, the value of\n\nthe NRSectorCarrier.noOfUsedRxAntennas attribute,\n\nand the value of the NRCellDU.autoSelectedModeOffset attribute, which\n\ncan increase or lower the P0 value. The\n\nautomatically\n\nselected P0 value is calculated\n\nfor each\n\nparticular antenna\n\ndeployment at cell\n\nsetup and cell reconfiguration. The selected value is applied as the\n\ninitial uplink received PSD power for PUSCH transmissions.\n\nThe NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant and the\n\nNRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschAutoSelected attributes can be used for\n\nboth the open-loop and closed-loop power control. For open-loop power control, the\n\ntransmission power is determined by the UE. When the NR Closed-Loop Power Control\n\nLow/Mid-Band feature is active, the gNodeB can instruct the UE to adjust the\n\ntransmission power. For more information, see: NR Closed-Loop Power Control Low/Mid-Band.\n\nWhen the value of the NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant attribute is set to\n\nanother value from 1000, the value of the\n\nNRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschAutoSelected attribute is cleared, because\n\nthe automated selection of a P0 value is no longer needed.\n\nThe value of the NRCellDU.autoSelectedModeOffset attribute, which\n\nprovides additional offset, can be configured depending on the network conditions to\n\nprioritize either interference mitigation or the maintenance of peak uplink throughput.\n\nThis value controls the uplink received PSD targets of the gNodeB when closed-loop power\n\ncontrol is used, for both the manually set and the auto-selected P0 nominal values.\n\nThe default value of the attribute is 6 dB. This means that when the default value is\n\nused, a margin is given for a 6 dB rise of IpN (interference + noise added for each\n\nPRB). For example, if the IpN is -120 dBm/PRB, 6 dB added as offset means an IpN target\n\nlevel of -114 dBm.\n\nThe NRCellDU.autoSelectedModeOffset attribute can be configured in the\n\nfollowing ways for optimization:\n\n- When throughput is a concern, increasing the value of the attribute, depending on the deployment, can help to maintain peak uplink throughput.\n- When uplink interference is a concern, decreasing the value of the attribute, depending on the deployment, can help mitigating the effects of the interference.\n\nWhen the value of the NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschGrant attribute is set to\n\n1000, the value set for the\n\nNRCellDU.autoSelectedModeOffset attribute affects the value of\n\nthe NRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschAutoSelected attribute. Changing the value\n\nof the NRCellDU.autoSelectedModeOffset attribute by 1 dB affects the\n\nuplink received PSD target of the gNodeB when the NR Closed-Loop Power Control\n\nLow/Mid-Band feature is active by 1 dB. However, as the P0 value transmitted to the UE\n\ncan only be an even number, the change might not be apparent in the value of the\n\nNRCellDU.pZeroNomPuschAutoSelected attribute. The uplink received\n\nPSD target of the gNodeB for uplink closed-loop power control is still updated by 1 dB,\n\nwhich can be used to fine-tune the targets of the gNodeB. For more information, see\n\n3GPP TS 38.331 Release 16 and 3GPP TS 38.213 Release\n\n16.\n\nFigure 2 shows the calculation of\n\nthe transmission\n\npower used by the\n\nUE.\n\nFigure 2   Calculation for UE Transmission Power\n\nRelated Information\n\nNR Closed-Loop Power Control Low/Mid-Band\n\n# 4 Network Impact of Scheduler Low-Band\n\nThe\n\nfeature ensures efficient resource assignment for UEs and reduces equipment heating by\n\ncontrolling energy output. The scheduling of resources is based on the current channel\n\ncondition and buffer status.\n\nCapacity and Performance\n\nThe number of PDSCH and PUSCH scheduling entities is related to the RTT latency. The\n\nincreased number of scheduling entities can decrease the RTT latency if the number\n\nof connected users is high, so the number of active UEs can be reduced because of\n\nfaster scheduling. Lower latency can provide increased TCP throughput.\n\nThe MAC resource use in downlink and in uplink can be increased for the slots that\n\nhave sufficient available resources. The downlink and uplink MAC cell throughput can\n\nalso be increased depending on traffic characteristics.\n\nThe activation of the increased robustness of small downlink\n\ndata function decreases the downlink MAC cell throughput without degrading user perception, as\n\nMCS is expected to decrease for small data. The function converts padding bits to coding bits\n\nin small data transmissions, which decreases downlink HARQ BLER and VoNR packet loss. Downlink\n\nHARQ BLER for 64-QAM and 256-QAM might increase, although downlink HARQ BLER decreases.\n\nIf the increased robustness of small downlink data function is enabled, the downlink\n\nMCG and SCG radio resource switching might increase, so the\n\nGNBCUUPFunction.pmPdcpRadioResSwitchDlMcg and the\n\nGNBCUUPFunction.pmPdcpRadioResSwitchDlScg PM counters might\n\nalso increase\n\nThe increased number of PDSCH and PUSCH scheduling entities can result in more PDCCH\n\nblocking if PDCCH resources are limited, especially for a cell with smaller\n\nbandwidth, fewer PDCCH symbols, and if some UEs are in poor radio condition\n\nrequiring relatively higher CCE aggregation level.\n\nThe number of symbols that can be allocated to PDCCH is determined by the value\n\nallowed to be set in the NRCellDU.pdcchSymbConfig attribute. For\n\nmore information, see NR Multiple PDCCH Symbols Low/Mid-Band. The increased\n\nnumber of PDSCH or PUSCH scheduling entities can result in more frequent RLC\n\nACK/NACK in the opposite direction for RLC AM bearers. This can slightly increase\n\nthe scheduling latency in the opposite direction. If the number of scheduling\n\nentities is also increased in the opposite direction, this scheduling latency issue\n\ncan be solved or mitigated.
